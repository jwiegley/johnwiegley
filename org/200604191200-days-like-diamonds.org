#+BEGIN_VERSE
To me,
my days are as diamonds.
The moments of my life
are a precious gold;
the minutes and the hours -- priceless.

I should not sell them cheaply.
If I do not have time
for what concerns me most,
then who has my time?
And at what price did I barter it away?

A loving Creator
has created this mote of love.
My seconds are the soul of the gift.
They are, in fact, all that I am.
There can never be a dearer possession.

O, do not waste my days
in concern of where I am going!
or even of what I have been.
The Lover has summoned His friends.
Relax... enjoy the relationship.
