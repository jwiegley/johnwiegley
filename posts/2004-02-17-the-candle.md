    The candle is a master at love.  
    He stands tall, and presents himself  
    before his lover.  
    He kindles a divine spark in the heart  
    and sets the core of his being  
    ablaze with devotion.

    The temperature rises:  
    it burns him with sweet fire.  
    He begins to melt away  
    in thought of her;  
    he sighs in hot wisps  
    that rise on the air.

    As he thinks of his beloved  
    he weeps away precious tears,  
    for he soon comes to realize  
    one of love's mysteries:  
    that truly to love,  
    the lover must disappear.

    Thus, his hardened self yields to liquid,  
    then to fire, then to light.  
    He brightens her face by his feeble flame --  
    and she calls it romantic;  
    he grants her a moment's peace  
    in fighting off the shadows of the night.

    And though he burns his life away,  
    what he is now, is his lover's delight --  
    for he has found the immortal Way:  
    her happiness is his happiness.
