| Do you feel the holy pain
| scratching at your heart?
| With a hard, rasping finger --
| He beckons you.
|
| It needles -- till we beg for more --
| it sounds the lovers' wail,
| who crucify their hearts
| for a taste of Resurrection.
|
| So pass round the cup!
| full and bittersweet,
| regaling us with tales
| till we lose our trepidation.
|
| For each is a wanderer
| on this trail of night;
| and painful to the eye
| are its first rays of Light.
