    How can I speak without using Your voice?  
    What power of mine can move my tongue?

    Which of these words did I bring into being?  
    How much of their meaning was authored by me?

    Did I create the phenomenon of sound?

    In fact, what of "me" exists in the world?  
    How can I abstract myself from Creation?

    Then there is only Him: "There is no God but He."  
    What I call "soul" is a function of His singleness.

    I cannot even say "I am"; only that "He is".  
    Everything I thought was "I" is "He" --

    In this, one of His many forms,  
    reflected from this humble point of being.
