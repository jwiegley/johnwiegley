After many years of writing poetry, the experience has greatly changed
for me. I would like to note down some of these changes, and a bit of
what caused them.

In the beginning, I wrote poetry because it was fun to be clever with
words. Since "poetry" seemed to connote rhyme, everything I wrote
rhymed. It is a good thing that almost nothing from those days
survives...

Not knowing what made poetry "good", I neglected to realized this also
meant I did not know what was "bad". Like most beginning poets, since my
own verses were nothing like the famous poets, I assumed they were
terrible. I wrote trying to imitate, if not the exact sound, at least
the "ring of authenticity" those poems had. Which of course achieved
nothing of the sort, and just made me more frustrated.

A few lines from one of the poems of those days is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Seven men, with seven needs, but fourteen wants and half the time,
sit mindlessly before their doors, waiting for the set-down chime;
that signifies the mothership's arrival on her destined course:
the mission of that fated crew, a correlated Trojan Horse.

A society bereft of evil broke apart from common ways,
founded on the Io moon, distant from the mind decay.
Named themselves the LES: Society of the Leading Edge,
their need for money, law and doubt falling into voids of age.
#+END_EXAMPLE

This mode of writing continued for several years, in which I knew that I
was not writing with "my voice", but I did not know how to find it. It
is funny, now knowing how simple it is, that despite every effort it
escaped me. For the real blockage was not in finding my voice, but
accepting the voice that I had.

Once all the bad rhyming started to sound too awful, I avoided the
ugliness of the problem by moving to free verse. It was many years
before I started to write rhyming poems again. Free verse seemed to have
an air of originality that was attractive -- and also deceptive.

It continued that I wrote bad free verse several years, not knowing how
to progress. I strove for lines that had something of greatness in them,
that sounded as if they could be great. But what is great? By why
standard do we measure it? Knowing that greatness often defies the
standards of the day, I was sometimes impressed by lines that did not
sound good at all, but because they were odd or unique. Yet none of
those poems could stand the test of time. I read them today and they
appear lifeless, as though grasping at something they could not achieve.

After thirteen years of sporadic writing, nothing much changed. Then
came a time when I started to think about quality, and about what makes
good things good. It would lengthen this essay too much to cover those
ideas here. The basic summation is that something is good if you find it
to be good. That is, does it please you?

This turned out to be revolutionary in terms of my writing, because it
undoes the need for a standard entirely. Instead of writing verses that
longed for something outside myself, I begin to pen whatever it made me
happy to write. This in turn made the experience of writing enjoyable,
and I learned my first genuine lesson about poetry: that it satisfies
the soul in its own way.

Here is the first poem I ever wrote without reflecting on how it might
sound to others. It was a joy to write, and changed my experience of
poetry from that day forward:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Without the light
it would not be seen;
without eyes
it would not be seen.

Between these two forms of nothing
a being of phenomenon
neither in the object
or the eye or the light.

But there... a subtle shading of rose
shaped into a smile
beneath eyes
like my own hope given form.

There... what is that shaft
pushing its way into the labors of my heart?
ruining the moment's peace
and offering something
I would live without peace for
day upon day again.

Between two different kinds of void:
a thing to die for.
#+END_EXAMPLE

After this poem, I learned what "voice" is: Whatever gives expression to
your soul. Now I write, think, edit, rewrite, until each line rings like
a bell. When it resonates with my state of being, I consider it
complete. Sometimes I cannot find the words I need to make a poem ring.
Sometimes it is not hard at all. It seems to depend on a great many
factors. But the quality of "ringing" has to be there, or the experience
of writing does not fulfill itself. It feels like not being able to
express a thought clearly.

With the freedom of this idea, I realized quickly that free verse is
just one way of writing, and that in fact I prefer rhyme most of the
time. Most of what I write now has some sort of rhyming structure,
because it makes the poem more enjoyable to me. I even started to play
with rhyme, to experiment in different ways, seeking an ever richer
"tone".

The first experiment along these lines was inter-line rhymes, in
addition to rhymes in the usual places. These are unexpected rhymes that
add music to a verse without creating too much of a pattern. For
example, from an excerpt:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The seals below bump their heads,
the bears in white coats rumble their hunger;
against the black night, the white fox howls
and the rabbit hears him in the echoes of sleep.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here "rumble" and "hunger" are tied by the vowel in the stressed
position; "night" and "white" in the second line; "hears" and "sleep" in
the last. The creation of such rhymes is not always done consciously,
but I do notice and improve them while editing, trying to achieve a
musical feel without burdening the poem.

The next kind of rhyme is done using assonance and alliteration in much
the same way:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
A family of ill ones
still tucked in their beds,
sipping coughsyrup cocktails
to lighten their heads,
#+END_EXAMPLE

Here, "ill" and "still" are rhymed, as well as the expected "beds" and
"heads". The sound of "sipping" is meant to fit with "still", making the
verse feel more coherent when read. "coughsyrup" and "cocktails" are
obvious, while the "to" of the last verse is paired with the strong
"tucked" in the second verse.

It is harder to make these rhymes than end-of-line rhymes, because they
must be subtle. I give up if a word cannot be found that both
contributes to the meaning and the song; but already I have been
surprised by the flexibility and richness of the English language, and
how many things may be done with it. Being surprised by one's own poetry
has been one of the best parts of writing it.

The next type of rhyme is much more difficult. I call it "hidden rhyme".
British and Australian readers will recognize it, due to their "rhyming
slang". Basically it consists of finding a word that ryhmes with another
word not present in the poem, but unconsciously obvious because of the
poem's meaning. For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
The lilt of your gentle voice,
its dulcet tones,
its warm, mellifluous sound...
to a man's ears, what balm,
what anodyne peace;
I linger there in memory
until the pain of absence
grows profound.
#+END_EXAMPLE

This poem is about the sound of a woman's voice, and the pain I feel
when she is not around. That is, the pain is due to her silence. It
would be poor (or rather, too perfect) to write:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I linger there awhile
until the silence
grows profound.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Written this way, "in memory" is changed to "awhile", to balance with
the syllable count of the middle line and to construct a rhyme between
"awhile" and "silence". But the new verse is too obvious in its meaning:
Of course there is silence if I'm writing a poem. Since silence is often
described as "profound", the mere fact of using that adjective is enough
to suggest to an educated reader that silence is meant. This frees me to
use a different image, while still protraying the painful silence:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I linger there in memory
until the pain of absence
grows profound.
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now "absence" is rhymed with "silence" -- even though "silence" appears
nowhere in the poem. "memory" is used to better dsecribe where I am
lingering, and because it has a softer vowel, allowing the strong sound
of "pain" to come through. But none of these sounds are so sharp as to
obscure the final "profound", which refers clearly to the earlier
"sound" -- the subject of the poem. This verse is also a bit overful,
which makes it seem to falter a bit. This effect is talked about later.

There are other hidden rhymes in my poems, but I soon forget them, and
the experience becomes unconscious for me as well. But what they add is
a suggestion of depth and richer meaning than is presented by the words
themselves. I find this satisfying.

The most recent technique has been to play with broken rhythm. This is
when I intentionally use a less perfect syllable pattern to make a line
seem more "humble" with respect to another.[fn:1] For example:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Recall me to myself, for I soon forget
once thoughts of you have cast their net.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The first line of this couplet has too many syllable (four more than the
following), and when scanning the verse feels awkward. Yet this
awkwardness is intentional: because the first line talks about me, and
the second about the one I love. When read slowly, the weakness of the
first line makes the writer seem awkward, troubled, unsure; while the
brevity of the second line drives home exactly what is making him feel
that way: "thoughts of you".

Making the language used reflect the emotional content of what is
written causes parts of the poem to seem imperfect, in order that the
poem as a whole can achieve a higher perfection. The goal is that the
reading of the poem provokes a sighing, wishful quality -- so I play
with techniques to give the poem more of this. Dissonant rhymes can help
that effect, by emphasizing or enhancing the beauty of a contrasting
euphonous line. It is like the effect of placing a flower in an empty
room to heighten one's awareness of space.

Some of these latter techniques I borrow from looking at life, and the
ways nature and man-made creations achieve a greater effect than the
individual parts. A poem with perfect lines is fine, and sometimes had a
coherence and overall effect that is quite pleasant; but other times too
much perfection is stilted and lifeless: just as real people are never
so perfect. Little smudges, combined with invisible or other structures
in the poem, present a texture and richness that defy the reader's
perception, but all the moreso affect his soul.

Lastly, I am finding that love for the subject of a poem -- whether
nature, a person, or an idea -- contributes more than anything to its
final quality. If the heart that writes a poem is lifeless, often in my
case the result is lifeless. Writing about a beloved subject is like
pouring that love into a vessel of words. They come more easily, and the
various techniques I've learned can be applied without as much conscious
effort. Like mastery at anything, once you have the basics perfected,
your mind understands how to follow the bidding of your heart.

I leave with one of my favorite couplets, recently written:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Where banners once flew in proud disdain
a king now weeps for his kingdom's bane.
#+END_EXAMPLE

There is a vowel rhyme between "proud" and "now", and a very subtle
consonant rhyme between "flew" and "weeps". The basic rhyme of "disdain"
and "bane" is pronounced, with the effect that it makes the wistfulness
in the other syllables more pronounced, as if to convey the image of an
airy castle under attack. Similarly, the "banners" that once flew (a
strong word) are insensibly compared to the new-found weakness of the
"king" (a weak word). "king" is also repeated to emphasize the
plaintiveness at what has been lost. But the loss is not so terrible:
the king has fallen in love with his conqueror; and so the final "bane"
is the word that sticks in memory. There is even a subtle pairing
between "banner" and "bane", to suggestive a transformation of interest
on the king's part.

Not all of these correspondences were made consciously. But as I
mentioned above, the more one writes -- and especially about a beloved
subject -- the more his mastered techniques will come into play without
thought. However, I do notice many of these things in the intermediate
results, and use that consciousness of them to ensure the effect is
right, and that the poetry "sings".

At the end of it all, it matters only that what you write makes you
happy, or expresses your soul and relieves it of its solitude. Some of
my recent verses I have even started to memorize, because it causes me
joy to recite them. That, I think, is the true test of one's poetry.

[fn:1] A few days after writing this I learned about the Japanese idea
       of "wabi-sabi": "Wabi-sabi is the quintessential Japanese
       aesthetic. It is a beauty of things imperfect, impermanent, and
       incomplete. It is a beauty of things modest and humble. It is a
       beauty of things unconventional... A related term in literature
       and the arts is"clinamen”, the act of deliberately breaking a
       stylistic rule to enhance the beauty of an otherwise perfect
       whole.”
