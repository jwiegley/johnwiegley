#+title: Why does God send Prophets?

If God is All-Powerful, He doesn't need a Prophet to make Himself known
to mankind. This implies that either He doesn't exist, or He doesn't
want people to know Him in such an easy, automatic way. Perhaps there is
value in free will, and the freedom to arrive at a knowledge of God
through choice and determined effort. Perhaps that journey is part of
what knowing God means.

Imagine there were a powerful king, loved by all his subjects, who
wanted to choose companions for his court. He wouldn't open his doors
wide, because everyone would want to rush in. Instead, he sends out
counsellors to meet the people, learn their character, test them. This
is how he might find those true of heart, loyal, who love him for who he
is and not what he can do for them.
