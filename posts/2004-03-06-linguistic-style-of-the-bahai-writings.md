The difference between plain English and "high" English is roughly
similar to the difference between Bahá'u'lláh's language, and that of
the average Arab or Persian.  For whatever reason, Bahá'u'lláh chose to
write in a lofty form of expression, and Shoghi Effendi reflected this
decision by using a similar stylistic distinction in the English
translation.  If you ask a Persian or Arab, they will tell you that
Bahá'u'lláh is very difficult to read in the original, and that
sometimes His grammatical choices are not obvious.  I remember a
Lebanese man once who criticized a sentence in the Aqdas because its
structure seemed confusing to him.

So do we wrestle with understanding God's Will (the story of life on
Earth!), or do we seek to convert it to our preference?  I don't know an
easy answer to give the would-be critic.  A person either loves Truth in
whatever form, or they're looking for something else.

Perhaps that alone is the reason: To discover who will strive to go
beyond the words.

But at any rate, I do not think Shoghi Effendi's rendering would be
needlessly archaic.  I presume he intended something by it related to
the character of the original text, given that he was an interpretor and
not a revelator.
