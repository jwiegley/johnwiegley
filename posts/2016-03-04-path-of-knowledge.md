    First, He beckons you, to see if you will come;
    then He hides from you, until you seek Him;
    then He holds you back, until you brave His trials;
    then He robs you of joy, until you rejoice with Him;
    then He gives you pain, until you know its pleasure;
    then He shuns you, until you wait beyond the door;
    and then He scorns you, until you want nothing more.

    At last, He bestows on you all you have ever wanted,
    to know in the end: was it truly Him?
