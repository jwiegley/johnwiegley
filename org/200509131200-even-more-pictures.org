Been having lots of fun with the new camera lately. It seems that
shooting from a tripod greatly improves the quality of the images (which
is really no surprise). So here are
[[file:gallery/Colorado/Garden%20of%20the%20Gods/index.html][some new
images]] from the "Garden of the Gods" in Colorado Springs. Also, a few
more pictures have been added to the
[[file:gallery/Illinois/Chicago/index.html][Chicago gallery]].
