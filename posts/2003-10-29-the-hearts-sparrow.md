    To make your way anywhere,  
    seek out the heart's sparrow.  
    His cage is gilt of gold or green --  
    perhaps red, from human love,  
    or purple, from religion.

    His cry is constant, though fainter than silence;  
    his longing deeper than depth has knowledge of.  
    In every hidden desire, he is there:  
    showing you in dreams of vision  
    what eyes may never see:  
    crossing boundaries of both time and space,  
    explaining the past, comprehending the future.

    At this moment,  
    tell him what your heart desires  
    and your life will follow.

    For time is a funny thing:  
    we think we have none of it, but we do;  
    we think we have much of it, but we don't.
