These are a few notes jotted down during my trip to Oregon:

We are taught to see the world in terms of what it isn't. This is why
traffic bothers us: because we see our destination invisibly laid over
the current scene, and the difference as a gnawing lack. We evaluate
events compared to what they might have been. We live one life in the
body, and countless possible lives-that-aren't in the mind. Looking at
things in terms of their negative -- awareness by contrast -- I stop
seeing what /is/, which cannot be understood in terms of what isn't.
Could I learn a language, studying the words it doesn't contain?

People in a silent room seem to unconsciously hear the music that's not
playing, the sounds they aren't hearing. The omission of sound is what
troubles them. If they listened to the silence, what could be wrong with
it?

Thinking about what is not cannot inform me about awareness, since the
negative of awareness is exactly that of which I cannot be aware. If the
negative of my being cannot inform me about being, how can the negative
of life inform me about life?

Perhaps our awareness /is/ the present, is reality, is God as manifest.
What reason do I have, other than my education, to separate them?
Wherever one is, there's always the other. Could I be aware without that
of which I'm aware? Can that of which I'm aware exist without my
awareness of it? If they are inextricably linked, perhaps they are the
same thing.

When I think I know something, I stop looking at it. It's ignorance, in
which a person wants to learn, that causes us to look. Thus, ignorance
is more beneficial to awareness than knowledge. Knowledge is useful for
increasing the scope of our curiosity, granting us access to a greater
and more profound ignorance, increasing our thirst to know. But if it
remove our sense of ignorance, knowledge defeats itself. Awareness swims
in the unknown, moving from intrigue to intrigue; it dies without breath
on the shores of what is certain.
