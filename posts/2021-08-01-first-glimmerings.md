We have been gifted the first glimmerings of a vision of humanity that
transcends the differences currently tearing us apart. In everything we do, we
can be a beacon of hope toward this vision. Racism needs to end, as does
materialism and slavish devotion to image and rank. Dismantling is not enough.
People need to know there is something better on the other side, that this
great adventure is only beginning, that there are reasons to sacrifice for it
with joy. We can reflect this in our words, actions and attitude, and it will
have an effect. We can touch the heart of every righteous man! It begins with
transforming our inward life, then moving outward to combat the dark with
candle-like sacrifice of time and effort. And it needn’t be always through
acts of heroism; every crashing river is the united action of mere drops.
