    The wind whispers secrets  
    ears cannot hear,  
    its magics unknown to a  
    "heart possessed by fear".

    Gird up your faith!  
    Walk on those waves!  
    Find the hidden Gem  
    that hides before your eyes...

    For the moment is precious  
    and the days are short;  
    soon, this grand movie  
    will play to its end.

    So listen again --  
    listen a thousand times! --  
    to that coy, coquettish wind...  
    and when you hear its answer:  
    Ascend.
