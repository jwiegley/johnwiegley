If God is All-Powerful, He doesn't need a Prophet to make Himself known to
mankind. This implies that either He doesn't exist, or He doesn't want people
to know Him in such an easy, automatic way. Perhaps there is value in free
will, and the freedom to arrive at a knowledge of God through choice and
determined effort. Perhaps that journey is part of what knowing God means.

Imagine there were a powerful king, loved by all his subjects, who wanted to
choose companions for his court. He wouldn't open his doors wide, because
everyone would want to rush in. Instead, he sends out counsellors to meet the
people, learn their character, test them. This is how he might find those true
of heart, loyal, who love him for who he is and not what he can do for them.
