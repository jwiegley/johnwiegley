    The true mystic is a lion
    with the face of a kitten.
    Only his own kind know who he is.

    He speaks in the softest words --
    so soft, their name is "silence" --
    yet his tone resounds for days.

    He is a presence without presence:
    a stillness full of motion.
    While seated, he soars;
      over water, he strides.

    Like an invisible wind
    you never see him, though
    he works to great effect.

    Eating little, relishing everything;
    he never argues, but always wins.
    His life is a happy contradiction.

    The people think he is nothing --
    a kind of innocent child --
    to which he whole-heartedly agrees...

    For it is this very nothingness
    that makes him great.
