#+title: More on spiritual poverty

An individual has two parts, his spiritual, or divine nature, and his
self, or lower nature. His spirit is manifested by the soul, and his
self, within the material body.

The aim of religious is to perfect the individual, but this means the
whole person: where self becomes wholly subordinate to the spirit. If
spirit is a light, then self is the cold and crude lantern which encases
this light. It can also protect and nurture its flame; choice decides
whether it will hide or reveal the inner realities.

Because the lantern is the tangible thing, so self is the most direct
thing we can operate on. This can caused the goal of "perfecting the
individual" to become "perfecting the self".

For example, in the pursuit of knowledge, it seems most natural and
accessible to increase the knowledge of the self, through discipline and
learning. But this does not necessarily make the individual more wise.
In fact, it can seem in every way to be like wisdom -- to give every
appearance of it -- but it may still not be real wisdom.

The path of knowledge for the individual is to learn, as well as
knowable things, also the immensity of the unknown, of mystery, of God's
inscrutable Will. This knowledge must increase until the self utterly
abandons any feeling that it possesses real knowledge. At that point,
knowledge comes from its acquiescence before God, and dawns in the heart
through spiritual inspiration. "Fear God, and God will give you
knowledge".

So the individual is not perfected through enriching the self, even
though it seems that the self can acquire virtue and learn humility.
Instead, its humility must come from its awe of the Creator, and
trembling before His majesty. Whatever it may seem to possess is as
nothing, and this cannot be in thought alone. If he hold a cup full of
water, he must contemplate the Sea at all times.
