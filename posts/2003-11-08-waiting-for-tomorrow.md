    I lost myself to tomorrow.  
    The days landed like little birds  
    and carried my life away.

    I'd lit a candle so tomorrow could find me --  
    since the night was restless and dreamless --  
    but I'd used the hours of my life to feed the flame.

    I ate bread and meat to keep my strength up,  
    to be ready when He came.  
    But my own flesh is all I had for food.

    I never made it till dawn.  
    I'd stoked the fire with my last few bones,  
    and used my skin to build a shelter.

    When He found me, there was nothing left.  
    The little birds had taken it all away.  
    I'd lost myself waiting for tomorrow.
