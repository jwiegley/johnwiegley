Fear not, little seed.

The Farmer has destined
all good things for you:
A warm sun,
furry friends,
a refreshing breeze.

With what wisdom!
He thrust you in a hole,
pitch and dark;
airless, lightless;
every movement a struggle.
A world in every way opposite.

Never cease reaching
toward the sky you were promised.
Fear not, little seed,
Fear not.
