#+title: Pretty girl

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I see you wearing ringlets, in a pretty dress;
your skirt is more the shape than the cloth.
And your tiny blouse expertly contains
what my longing wishes free...

You are beautiful, my dear -- let none say otherwise.
I write you poems, but it's not enough;
I would rather feel your curves
than this smooth, white paper under my fingers.
