#+title: Why I love David Zindell

Because he writes like this:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
To want to see men and women standing tall as oaks, the sun rising warm
upon their faces, whole, happy and unafraid; to see them healed of
suffering in the light of that deep joy which pours itself out through
their hearts and unites them in glory with all things; to want this for
myself and all those I loved, and for everyone -- was this so wrong?

#+END_QUOTE

His /Danlo the Wild/ series is still one of my all-time favorites, if a
bit hard to find. It took me years to finally get the full five books
together.
