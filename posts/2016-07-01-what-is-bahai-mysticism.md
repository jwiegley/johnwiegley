The word "mysticism" has taken on various meanings throughout history, as have
the practices and beliefs of those who term themselves "mystics". Mysticism
can refer to seeking ecstatic union with God, insight into hidden truths, or a
radical transformation of the individual through various means. Defined
broadly in this way, mysticism may be found in nearly all world's religious
traditions, though its form varies from case to case.

Bahá'í mysticism incorporates many of these same elements, but emphasizes a
practical outcome: That is, it is not enough to feel union with the Divine,
one should see the Divine in every soul until it results in concrete actions
of brotherhood and love; hidden truths are not meaningful unless they embrace
and enrich the outward truths governing our daily lives; and transformation of
the individual is without merit until that individual becomes a source of good
for his society.

In this way, Bahá'í mysticism is a positive mode of belief, and seeks unity of
the inward and outward forms. It is not considered helpful, or in some cases,
even lawful, to employ fasting, asceticism, denial of pleasure, and withdrawal
from society, as a means for advancement along this path. Mysticism should
fundamentally connect the individual to the greater whole of humankind -- at
the level of our common, Divine origin -- until one arrives at a conception of
life such that the happiness of others is our happiness too, and all our
actions are motivated from this attitude.

In terms of specific practices, there are no rituals prescribed, and people
are mainly free to adopt whatever works for each person. Prayer, meditation,
and study of the Divine Texts, are the primary tools. The influence of the
Holy Spirit, God's unfailing grace, and ecstatic love, are indispensable.
Combined with reflection, imagination, and various art forms, a foundation is
established for one to act and reflect, examine motivations, question one's
understandings, and observe how one's effect on the world is improving day by
day.

What makes this fundamentally mystical in character is that Bahá'ís believe in
a spiritual world that is both greater than this life, and yet contains this
life within it, similar to a child gestating in the womb of its mother. The
embryo is aware of its own sphere, but lacks perception of the larger world
outside, even though most of its future is determined by the beings of that
world. The mother and father are very much aware of the child, even when it
has no awareness of them.

Similarly, a much greater, far more wondrous, existence awaits humanity after
this physical life; yet that spiritual world exists also here, and affects us
far more than we can ever realize. The mystic comes not only to expect these
otherworldly influences, but to employ them directly in his day to day life,
such as using prayer to overcome difficult problems. However, as mentioned
above, inward and outward must be in harmony: Prayer alone is not the way; it
is prayer followed by action, undertaken with the expectation that one's
prayers will be answered.

This mystical path, because it does not rely on extreme measures, or practices
divergent from ordinary belief, can be somewhat difficult to follow. In the
end it amounts to a fundamental, almost Copernican, shift in orientation:
placing God at the center of one's life, and revolving everything --
knowledge, opinions, even thought itself -- around that center. When the
purpose of life is seen not as fulfilling the will of the individual, but
wholly in terms of the Will of God, it changes how one sees even the most
mundane of things. And it is this: seeing beauty where other see plainness;
seeing purpose where others see chaos; seeing God where others see only dust
and decay: that truly sets apart the path of the mystic.
