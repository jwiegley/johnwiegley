#+BEGIN_VERSE
Two men prayed to God:
One said only one word
and was given a life of bounty in response.
The other prayed for decades...
but received only a drop.

Of these two,
I think the latter was much more fortunate.

Because,one day, these two will approach God.
To the first, He will ask:
"I gave you a life-time of bounty; why just one word?"
To the other He will say:
"For only a drop, you pledged your life."

If this life gives you suffering
  in answer for your prayers:
perhaps He answers another prayer,
to be asked by a future self.
