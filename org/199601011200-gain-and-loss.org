Someone who has nothing gains at every turn; but someone who has too
much, always perceives that they are losing it.

Although in our culture humility and lowliness are seen to be "lesser"
than fame and accomplishment, actually humility is a more positive state
of being: because a man of great pride will tend to be taken down from
his high station much more often, while the humble man -- the lower he
is -- will always find himself lifted.

So the poorer you are in the moment, the richer you are in life.
