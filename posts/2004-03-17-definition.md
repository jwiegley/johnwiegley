    I saw a tree in a forest,  
    and asked him, "Who are you?"  
    He said, "I'm the tallest tree around."

    I cut off his top --  
    making him level with the rest --  
    and asked again, "Who are you?"  
    He said, "A redwood; a mighty Sequoia."

    So I burned and destroyed his brothers,  
    till the statement "Sequoia" had lost its meaning,  
    and I asked again, "Who are you?"  
    He waited, then said,  
      "A member of the coniferous, cone-bearing family."

    I destroyed his family,  
    to the last sprouting tree,  
    and asked him again.  
    He said, "I am a tree, with branches reaching to heaven."

    So I wiped out all other species,  
    until he was completely alone on Earth.  
    And I asked again.  
    He waited longer, then said,  
    "I am a living, growing being."

    Then all matter I destroyed,  
    until there were no atoms but his atoms,  
    and I asked again, "Who are you now?"

    I have yet to hear his answer.
