title: Two poems
tags: journal

Not many thoughts recently -- life has been very full. But at least a
couple of poems: [[file:letter.to.watchman][letter to the watchman]], a
reference to a Bahá'í story from
[[http://www.bahai-library.com/writings/bahaullah/sv/700.html][The Seven
Valleys) (my favorite of all books]]; and
[[file:tales.i.tell.myself][tales I tell myself]], just some errant
musing.
