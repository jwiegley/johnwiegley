#+title: Poisoned flour

As long as we keep baking with poisoned flour, the act of feeding
humanity will not have the final, desired result.

What I mean to say is that we can go through all the right motions, but
if our motives, and the spirit with which we act, still bears feelings
and attitudes of prejudice, a sense of superiority, a tendency to be
exclusive, etc., then the society that results from those efforts will
continue to have the ills of the Old World embedded within it, and thus
it will not be --- cannot be! --- the future envisioned for us by
Bahá'u'lláh.
