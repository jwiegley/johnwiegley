    All I would need is to hang like a fish
    on the shining hook of that moment,
    yanked about whichever way the Fishmonger wished
    stripped of my armory scales
    robbed of my heart, my lungs
    stretched over the burning flames
    and roasted into a pale memory --
    a moment's taste upon His lips.

    Thus am I reunited:
    I have found the way to mingle flesh.
    It requires only the mystery of that moment...

    Yet how quickly they would lead me away;
    how quickly they would counsel me never to look again.

    I suppose it makes a bad worker
    who has such a view of the sky in front of him
    into which the wings of his soul
    long to escape their frustrated peace.
