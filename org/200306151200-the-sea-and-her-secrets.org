#+BEGIN_VERSE
Here is a chest whose lid we cannot grasp
that needs no lock
that rubs out the messages
we send her on the sand.

Even the sun cannot fathom her.
Whole regions of permanent night,
a wet fist clasping
the very whole of Earth...

The deeps that lie beneath
are not for you and me.
The pearls that gather eternally there
will ever remain the secrets of the sea.
