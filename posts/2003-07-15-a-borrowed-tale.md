    The moon speaks of its faraway sun  
    in phrases of luminous rhyme and verse.  
    It has no better story to tell.  
    Its own form, the lines of its speech;  
    every action a reference,  
    every word a suggestion.  
    It is a great mouth of light  
    whose tale is the greatness of Another.
