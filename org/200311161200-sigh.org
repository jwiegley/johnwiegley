#+BEGIN_VERSE
The day rose upon a sheltered rock,
Round, simple and plain,
And after I heard what I heard on that rock
My life I will never regain.

Here I write, adrift on a sea
Of blood that's poured from my heart.
I find no peace, I know no joy
Whenever I find I'm apart

From she, my dream that can never be lived,
My star in the darkest of night,
Who guides me into the meadow of love,
Who shows me the path to delight.

My sun, my day, my life and my hope --
That one I can never describe:
Perhaps the thing that captures it best
Is the soul-stirring breath of a sigh.

And my love:
That day
I learned new places to sigh from.
