    How can I describe being together?  
    Every inch of you  
    reached miles into me.

    Your hair  
    more than beautiful strands of black,  
    like a dark river where my fingers  
    wandered and strayed.

    Your whole being  
    was a banquet of heart and mind  
    to fill my beating cup.

    I walk away from your table  
    drunk every time --  
    flush until my heart is dizzy.

    If children laugh at my staggering walk  
    let them know  
    how weak your memory makes me.

    I am "ghani" now: rich like a king  
    whose eyes see only gold;

    Or a fish, not contented with drops  
    who in your ocean feels no need.
