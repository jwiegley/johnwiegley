#+title: A leaf falls

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A leaf falls into the river,
swept away --
entreaties are useless --
the swift beat of time
marked in nearing the sea.
Turning and turning,
jade green on the dark green below,
and then nothing...

Just the river, and the tree
and my memory
to count the loss.
#+END_VERSE
