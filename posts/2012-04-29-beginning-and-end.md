title: The beginning and the end

There is a recurring theme in the Writings, both Islamic and Bahá'í, of four
divine states which are referred to in the verse: "He is the first and the
last, the Seen and the Hidden." It is also found in the New Testament, where
it says "I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the
last."

Bahá'u'lláh expounds on this theme in the Valley of Unity, yet it is also
found in the Valley of Knowledge.  In the story of the lover and his beloved,
the lover starts in the "world of the beginning".  After he is pursued by the
watchmen, he comes upon his beloved and is transported to the "world of the
end".

These two worlds exist in the vision of the wayfarer.  Between them is the
illusory reality of Time, through which men must pass.  Owing to these two
worlds, change is witnessed.  Because of them, the Prophets appear to have
different names, and speak in different tongues.  Otherwise, in the realm of
unity, "This is the changeless Faith of God, eternal in the past, eternal in
the future."

Consider yourself in a difficult situation.  Without knowing the outcome, you
may be seized by fear, or wonder at what may happen.  You are in the "world of
firstness".  In this condition "the end is veiled to you", and people are wont
"to make their pliant in the beginning."

After the passage of time, and the appearance of change, we learn the outcome
of our situation.  We may be happy, or sad, but now things are complete.  We
have entered "the world of lastness", and come to the end of our waiting.

It is possible, through faith, and insight into the ways of God, to perceive
"the end in the beginning".  That is, while dwelling in the world of the
first, it is as though we look across a gorge, and see the details of the
world of the last.  We take heart in what we see, and our apprehension of the
unknown leaves us.  Because God "[has] ordained for thy training every atom in
existence and the essence of all created things", we come to perceive even the
next life from the vantage point of this life, and learn that everything which
occurs materially is for the benefit of spiritual progress.  Thus the gap of
death is bridged, and we are filled with a spiritual joy that is beyond this
world.

This is the station of those in the valley of Knowledge, and by such insight
the wayfarer can reach across the boundaries of Time.  It is an attribute of
those who see the large in the small, the tree in the seed, the future in the
present.  This is the last world of limitation, for limitations require
separation, and separation implies differences.

He says, "... the people of the Valleys above this see the end and the
beginning as one..."  In this condition, the world of the beginning is not
different from the world of the end.  Whatever situation we find ourselves in,
and however we may seem to other people, we are actually dwelling in the world
of the end, though our surroundings have the appearance of the world of the
beginning.

To give a concrete example of this: In the game of chess, players are ranked
according to their ability on a scale from 0 to 3000.  The greater the
numerical separation between players, the greater the likelihood that the
higher player will win.

At a tournament, where people are playing to win, let's assume that you are
rated 3000, and your opponent is rated 0.  This means that you have no
possibility of losing.  Although no pieces have been moved, and you sit in the
world of the first, because of your certitude you already count the game as
won.  You already experience the joys and emotions of the world of the last.
Indeed, no matter what apparent "changes" occur on the board, they have no
reality, and time in this case is just a show.

Likewise for the other player.  The end and the beginning are one, and while
we may see the players at the "beginning", they themselves already dwell in
the "end".  They do not just see the end in the beginning; their emotions,
vision, and reality concerning the end and the beginning is one.

This is the station of `Abdu'l-Bahá saying "The Temple is already built."  For
Him, Who saw the condition of the believers at that time, the Temple already
existed in its full splendour.  I imagine He was able to revel in the creation
of the believers, and experienced joy at what they had/will build.  Time was
but a show, a non-thing.  In the spiritual worlds, the cornerstone and the
Temple were one.

This implies a complete transcendence of the conditions of this life, which
seems so ruled by boundaries and temporal causation.  It is no wonder that
Bahá'u'lláh said that the valley of Knowledge "is the last plane of
limitation".  Here the spirit is free, and appearances no longer affect it.
Owing to the saying, "Verily we are from God, and to Him shall we return", he
sees the Face of God everywhere, for has he not already returned?  Bahá'u'lláh
says, "... what life have words, on such a plane, that `first' and `last' or
other than these be seen or mentioned!  In this realm, the first is the last
itself, and the last is but the first."

He then continues, "Nay rather, the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in
the green garden land, see not even `neither first nor last'; they fly from
all that is first, and repulse all that is last." In Gems of the Mysteries,
Bahá'u'lláh writes, "In this station change and alteration are pure idolatry
and unadulterated belief." In this realm of the Infinite, change is not only
unreal, it is uncreate.  "Knowledge is a single point, but the ignorant have
multiplied it."  Here there is no believer, for as He said, "There was God and
there was naught beside Him".  And further, "This is the plane whereon the
vestiges of all things are destroyed in the traveler, and on the horizon of
eternity the Divine Face riseth out of the darkness, and the meaning of 'All
on the earth shall pass away, but the face of thy Lord...' is made manifest."

Even love, which implies a lover, debars one from this realm, as it has been
said, "Love is a veil betwixt the lover and the loved one; more than this I am
not permitted to tell."
