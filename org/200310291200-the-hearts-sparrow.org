#+title: The heart's sparrow

#+BEGIN_VERSE
To make your way anywhere,
seek out the heart's sparrow.
His cage is gilt of gold or green --
perhaps red, from human love,
or purple, from religion.

His cry is constant, though fainter than silence;
his longing deeper than depth has knowledge of.
In every hidden desire, he is there:
showing you in dreams of vision
what eyes may never see:
crossing boundaries of both time and space,
explaining the past, comprehending the future.

At this moment,
tell him what your heart desires
and your life will follow.

For time is a funny thing:
we think we have none of it, but we do;
we think we have much of it, but we don't.
