title: Love for it all
tags: journal

I have been reading, on blogs and bulletin boards, about killing Mara,
committing one's self to rigorous discipline, changing our lives,
etc. -- but rarely in reference to the Goal.  The glory of the means is
so much praised, I often don't hear about the cherished end.

A controlled life, where all evil is exterminated, where Mara is gone,
where nothing untoward ever happens again: it sounds like a fight
against evil, more than a lust for good.  At the end, do people really
want such an antiseptic existence?  A place of all white, with singing
angels and always perfect food; a place without hunger, where I would
never again feel the bliss of breaking fast?

I fight for the path of love, but seem unable to describe it.  It boils
down to this: I want life to be as it is.  I want the heartache, the
pain, the hardship.  I want my Tourette's Syndrome, which makes my body
a pain to carry around.  I want discomfort, and hunger, and worrying
about my bank account.  Because all of these things give me access to
what living is really about: appreciation, love, a breath-taking
admiration at the end of a very long climb.

And so, even as I work to combat evil and falsehood -- which I am the
victim of from time to time -- I thank evil for the chance it gives me
to champion good.  How could I ever show good my willingness to arise in
its Cause, if it were not for evil?

I am finding, gradually, that I love the lot of it, the whole system.
It seems so perfectly constructed: so rich, and dirty, and gritty -- and
real.  It makes even simple things, like sincerity, seem beautiful.  At
least I have a friend in this regard in Herman Hesse, in his wonderful
little book *Siddhartha*:

> During deep meditation it is possible to dispel time, to see
> simultaneously all the past, present and future, and then everything
> is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman.  Therefore, it
> seems to me that everything that exists is good -- death as well as
> life, sin as well as holiness, wisdom as well as folly.  Everything is
> necessary, everything needs only my agreement, my assent, my loving
> understanding; then all is well with me and nothing can harm me.  I
> learned through my body and soul that it was necessary for me to sin,
> that I needed lust, that I had to strive for property and experience
> nausea and the depths of despair in order to learn not to resist them,
> in order to learn to love the world, and no longer compare it with
> some kind of desired imaginary world, some imaginary vision of
> perfection, but to leave it as it is, to love it and be glad to belong
> to it.
