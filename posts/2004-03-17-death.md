| Within a dream I dreamt of another place
| where the heart does not toil, nor the body ache.
|
| Where the pen is a lonely instrument,
|   for the spirit is busy wandering.
| Not trapped in its sighs like a chambered ghost,
| but forever seeing, feeling,
| without pause to transcribe or explain.
|
| My heart is a fish on that bright sea;
| the depths are its home.
| When the storms rage, there is only peace.
