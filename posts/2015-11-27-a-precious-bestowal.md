"All that is in heaven and earth I have ordained for thee, except the human
heart..."

God made us in order for our hearts to turn toward Him; but He desires that to
happen willingly and sincerely. For such to be true, we must always be free
either to believe or not believe. I don't mean membership in a Faith either,
but what we really think about God in our hearts.

If the sun hugged the Earth, the Earth would burn away: it would destroy the
fragile life of our planet. So instead, the glory of the sun is mediated
through its rays, allowing us to receive its heat and light, but in a form we
can survive.

If God stood before you today, and manifested undeniable proof of His Being,
your purpose in having been created would vanish. He knows that He is real; He
doesn't need your belief. Your love would then be automatic, and not the true
love of which the human soul is capable. He hides Himself in order that you
may know the inimitable joy of finding Him.

We live this life in the darkest of nights, that we might come to apprehend
even the least glimmerings of His truth. And when the dawn finally comes, and
our souls are freed from these bodily cages, we will be in a position to
cherish every revelation.

Imagine you were a wealthy king, and wanted your newborn son to value and
appreciate the kingdom he would inherit. Likely the best method would be to
allow him to be raised in poverty and squalor, unaware of his inheritance,
enduring the pain of his fellow subjects. Yet what mortal king has such love
and self-denial, that he would allow his infant son to suffer, in order to
bring about that future king's most noble self?

Everywhere around you -- in the darkness, the pain, the suffering -- is the
manifestation of a love so great, it is both invisible, and entirely
mysterious and bewildering. If it were otherwise, how could it offer its
ultimate prize?
