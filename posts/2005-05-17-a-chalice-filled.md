| I was a crystal chalice
| open, and waiting for the rains to pour.
| Since youth I had longed for fullness.
| It seemed my being had been made
| in the shape of something
| I was meant to find.
|
| But for so long, I was a bearer of hollows.
| My bones made dull groans
| as the winds passed over me.
| I trembled when the Earth trembled,
| and viewed every precipice
| with shattered dreams.
|
| The she came into my life.
| She poured forth, from a long, fluted stem;
| filling all my spaces with her ruby kiss.
| She intoxicated me, my lady Wine,
| and made every dark place
| smile with an inner glow.
|
| We are quite a pair, she and I.
| When other lips come for *sohbat*
| they stumble away down dark alleys,
| unable to bear the heady laughter.
|
| I was a chalice, once;
| now I am only a taste, divine,
| borne aloft in Saghi's arms.
