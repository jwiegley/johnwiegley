    When the smell of rain
    is fuller than the rain itself...

    When one drops fall
    and then a thousand;
    when the first bolt
    divides the sky;
    when a clap resounds
    like the Hands of God;
    and the water on your lips
    fell from Heaven...

    After the fury and the darkness
    will shine every color
    that eyes can see.
