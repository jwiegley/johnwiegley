#+title: Ultimate symbol of detachment

That "la" in the phrase "La ilaha illa al-llah" is the ultimate symbol
of detachment. Because in that "la", nothing else has significance in
itself. When Plato says that the most significant thing for a
philosopher to achieve is the ability to see things in themselves, he
would discover that everything in the world, and all imaginings, are
vacant. That there is only Him.
