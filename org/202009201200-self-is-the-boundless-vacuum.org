#+BEGIN_VERSE
The seeker's true enemy is finding
for the event dispels his being.
Neither does a moth collect embers
nor any shadow become an expert on daylight.

Self is incompatible with love,
who abhors the line between "you" and "I".
In the end, love itself is a mighty veil,
because what is yearning without separation?

The longing of a broken thing to be made whole;
the discordance of a melody missing its final note.
Self is the boundless vacuum that dare not breathe
though its marrow be a plaint for reunion.
