    Religion
    teaches brotherhood, but divides men;
    proclaims love, but breeds hatred;
    calls for peace, but engenders war;
    applauds charity, but hoards like a scrooge;
    talks spirituality, but practices greed.

    Then, obviously,
    we are not talking about religion.

    Religion is a delicate flower
    man has crushed by his ignorance.
    Now we look at that dead, brown relic,
    and assume we know what it meant.

    Yet... flowers always bloom again.
