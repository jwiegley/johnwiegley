title: The life we live

    The deepest part of my being
    I have never shared with anyone;
    so that between me and the world
    there is a fiction -- called "self" --
    which interacts according to our
    puerile desires of security and pleasantry.

    For they would have me believe
    that my spirit is either non-existent,
    or too fragile,
    to withstand the burden of such a revelation.

    To hell with them.

    What kind of life are they living?
