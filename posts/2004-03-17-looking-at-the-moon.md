    I look at the moon:
    two innocent spheres of white
    joined by light with a kindred form.

    My spirit is already there:
    only my body holds back:
    since gravity has thrown about a cloak
    which my being wears
    reluctantly.

    And the cloak is the body itself:
    a fleshy jacket
    to retard the soul's celerity.

    Otherwise, I would blaze out
    in a single instant
    and make my home upon that star,
    in the fields of infinite beauty.
