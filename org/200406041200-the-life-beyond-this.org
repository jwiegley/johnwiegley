#+title: The life beyond this

What if the world we see is like an image reflecting off of still water;
when we die, we will step across into the source of that reflection. In
which case, there is a value to this mundane world that is directly
linked to the spiritual worlds, though it contain no substance of its
own. So when we pass on, we will not be leaving things behind in one
sense -- the reflection being in some ways the same as the thing
reflected -- we will only be leaving behind the pool that offered us our
first glimpse into Beauty.

What we see here are the "the brilliant rays of the divine sun shining
from the dawning-point of Essence alike on all created things", and thus
here too we can commune with our Goal. Putting aside the mortal coil
will simply free our vision, and liberate that communion from all
impediment -- if we're ready to handle it. But there is nothing about
this world per se to be scorned; it's simply a matter of seeing the
message in the letter -- and falling in love with its Author, not the
paper it was written on!

There are several mystics connected now via a web of blogs: Sina,
Noufal, Daniela, Arya (and Chris, though he has no blog yet). Believing
as we all do in the mystical, and the powers of faith to affect reality:
What if we started a regimen of prayer for the increase of each other's
vision? Whenever people have prayed for me in the past, it has always
had an impact. I will start those prayers tonight, and would love to
hear about the wonderful coincidences that begin appearing in my
friend's lives...
