    If I speak to you of the sea,
    feel it rolling through your heart,
    carrying you to lands unknown
    beyond the cloudy ridge of mystery.

    She changes shape, temper,
    strength and rhythm,
    even as we speak of her --
    because we speak of her --
    one whose waters feed on our dreams.

    Last night I lay with the sea,
    her arms enfolding me a thousand times.
