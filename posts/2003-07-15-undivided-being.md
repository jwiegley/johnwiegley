    It began undivided;
    it was the light of life --
    and light shines by its own brilliance.

    Then, for a reason not given,
    this was no longer enough.
    Not that it was not, but now... a belief.

    The light did a strange thing,
    it tried to contain itself in a single form
    so it could be seen --

    Because the rays of light
    that illumine beauty
    are invisible in themselves.

    So the light made a hole in space
    and began to pour itself in.
    "they return to that fire which feedeth on their own souls."

    This imprisoned energy become matter,
    now tied to a time and place
    but no longer able to shine.

    It could only become known
    by absorbing the light of others:
    reflecting back what it could no longer give.

      A light that was free, unkept,
      poured itself into a hole
      that it might be known.

    But now it cannot grasp its purpose.
    Life, somehow, does not seem right.
    It polishes the bars... but something is wrong.
