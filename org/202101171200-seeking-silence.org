#+BEGIN_VERSE
If you ask questions to find silence,
  you've failed.
If you say anything at all,
  this is not helpful.
What you seek is exactly as far from you
  as your seeking.
When you've abandoned all words, that.

And a favorite verse by Rumi:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
This silence, this moment, every moment,
if it's genuinely inside you,
brings what you need.
There's nothing to believe.

Only when I stopped believing in myself
  did I come into this beauty.
Sit quietly, and listen for a voice
that will say, 'Be more silent.'

Die and be quiet.

Quietness is the surest sign that you've died.
Your old life was a frantic running from silence.

Move outside the tangle of fear-thinking.
