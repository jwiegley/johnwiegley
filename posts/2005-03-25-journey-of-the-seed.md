| I remember being planted
| in the soft Earth.
| It was warm there,
| comfortably dark.
| I slept for ages --
| though an aching tension
| grew within me.
|
| Soon the changes came
| that would change me forever.
| I grew, and sprouted,
| yielding what I had
| to offer life.
|
| These grains were taken
| and ground into fine dust
| as if having no value at all.
| I was astonished the Miller
| would treat me so.
| Did he not perceive my beauty?
|
| Then this dust,
| the fruits of my time on Earth,
| were placed in a fire and burnt;
| mixed with water and kneaded.
| I was twice baptized
| then pounded and shaped
| and pounded again.
|
| I asked the Baker:
| "Why heap your indignites upon me?
| First the Miller and now you,
| what ever happened to my dear friend,
| the Farmer?
| Why did he release me
| to such misery?"
|
| As if not enough, the Baker
| took me to the oven
| and showed me the awful beauties of flame.
| I was scorched and hardened;
| my doughy crust became like stone.
|
| At the same time I puffed up.
| My skin was tanned.
| I became like a proud soldier --
| though burning in a fire
| and begging for escape.
| Will no one treat me well?
|
| At last I emerged,
| and was whisked away
| to the table of Bounty.
| I saw many fruits there,
| many delicate wines,
| but they all compared themselves to me,
| each asserting its superiority.
|
| Then the Host plunged his sword
| into my back
| and cleaved me in twain.
| I was cut and cut,
| not bleeding, but sighing out steam.
| Even this One did not cherish me!
|
| At the instant of my final despair
| when I thought I could bear no more
| this Host led me to His lips
| and bestowed on me
| His fatal kiss.
|
| I passed into His mouth
| and was ground up -- again --
| between His mighty teeth.
| I traveled down the throat
| and landed
| in a lake of searing acid.
|
| My life has been pain after pain!
| an unending torment --
| every moment of peace
| concluded by a new anguish.
|
| In that dark and foul place,
| as the liquids ate my bowels,
| I contemplated the injustices of life.
| I thought long and hard,
| even though my mind was fading...
|
| When there was almost nothing left
| I bade the world goodbye
| and plunged into my death.
|
| This has been the tale of my death;
| but of the life that came after
| I can say nothing.
|
| Look to the face of my Beloved:
| In the health of His ruddy glow
| perhaps you can discern me.
