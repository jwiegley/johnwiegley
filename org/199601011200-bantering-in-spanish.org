#+title: Bantering in Spanish

At Conchita's Ice Cream this afternoon, while eating a double-scoop of
Cinnamon Chocolate and Coffee Almond Fudge, I met two very pleasant
people who had moved to this country from Honduras -- Benjamin and
Gloria. They told me that the population of their country is only six
million people! They were both very sweet, and my heart went out to
them. It's funny how speaking in another language takes away the feeling
of necessity that I have for communicating something worthwhile. In that
context -- because I'm also learning the spoken medium itself -- I find
that chit-chat is a nice way to connect with people without having to be
too serious. Yet in English this doesn't work out the same for me.
Interesting.
