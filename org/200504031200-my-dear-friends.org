#+BEGIN_VERSE
How can I say if I love God more,
or you, my dear friends?

When I want to hear Him laugh,
I tell you the joke.

When I want to ease His pain,
I offer you the balm.

Whenever you smile, I see Him;
whenever you sigh, I hear Him:

For if He is the Light
and you are His candles,

I need add but a spark of love --
and suddenly He appears.
