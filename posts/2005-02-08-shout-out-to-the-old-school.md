Back when the Apple IIe was *the* machine for home computing, and every
geek knew his 65C02 opcodes like the back of his hand, I used to
co-sysop for my friend Ted on his bulletin board, *The Magnetic Page*.
Back then, almost twenty years ago, I was Little John, and had a host of
friends whom I never met in person.  I wonder where those guys are now,
and what they're up to...  So here are a few hellos to:

* Ben, the Phantom
* Ted, the Pook
* Rich, the Data Wizard
* Rob, the Ghost
* Rusty, Blue Adept
* Bob, the Saltine
* Roman, the Crasher
