This movie was playing in an arts theater in Tempe, Arizona.  A girl in
a specialty shop told me it was about quantum physics; and since the
poster sounded interesting, I figured it was worth a try.

What surprised me most was that this movie played like a dramatized
version of my earlier essay, [The Faith Dynamic](faith.dynamic).  I found this
astonishing, since I'd figured no one else was thinking along those
lines.

I give the movie 8.5 out of 10.  The confluence of ideas is partly why
it affected me so strongly (some of the lines were nearly quotes from my
essay), but the friend I saw it with enjoyed it, too.

In keeping with the theme of the movie, I wonder if my own efforts to
understand these things hasn't resulted in my opportunity to see this
film.  You'll have to watch to understand better what that means...
