An individual has two parts, his spiritual, or divine nature, and his self,
or lower nature.  His spirit is manifested by the soul, and his self,
within the material body.

The aim of religious is to perfect the individual, but this means the whole
person: where self becomes wholly subordinate to the spirit.  If spirit is
a light, then self is the cold and crude lantern which encases this light.  It
can also protect and nurture its flame; choice decides whether it will hide
or reveal the inner realities.

Because the lantern is the tangible thing, so self is the most direct thing
we can operate on.  This can caused the goal of "perfecting the individual"
to become "perfecting the self".

For example, in the pursuit of knowledge, it seems most natural and
accessible to increase the knowledge of the self, through discipline and
learning.  But this does not necessarily make the individual more wise.  In
fact, it can seem in every way to be like wisdom -- to give every
appearance of it -- but it may still not be real wisdom.

The path of knowledge for the individual is to learn, as well as knowable
things, also the immensity of the unknown, of mystery, of God's inscrutable
Will.  This knowledge must increase until the self utterly abandons any
feeling that it possesses real knowledge.  At that point, knowledge comes
from its acquiescence before God, and dawns in the heart through spiritual
inspiration.  "Fear God, and God will give you knowledge".

So the individual is not perfected through enriching the self, even though
it seems that the self can acquire virtue and learn humility.  Instead, its
humility must come from its awe of the Creator, and trembling before His
majesty.  Whatever it may seem to possess is as nothing, and this cannot be
in thought alone.  If he hold a cup full of water, he must contemplate the
Sea at all times.
