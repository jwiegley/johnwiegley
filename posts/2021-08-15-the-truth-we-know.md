title: The truth we know

The truth we know is a concept, a proof that something is well-defined based
on what we’re willing to accept.

An "apple" is not true, nor does it exist. It's a name for what you hold in
your hand. For example, you may think that the apple occupies a clearly
defined space, but our ability to smell is because its molecules permeate the
surrounding air. The distinction between “apple” and “not apple“ is chosen
based on the senses, not what evidently is.

Scientific evidence is used to confirm or deny our theories about physical
reality. It doesn’t "tell" us anything about realities outside of human
awareness and understanding. Sometimes a discovery will point to something we
don’t see yet, and this expands our vision, but never has a phenomenon
explained to us what the universe is, or why it behaves the way it does.

Common-sense truths are shorthands and many of them are wrong in greater
contexts. The appearance of objects likewise is a function of time, of
probabilities in electro-static tension. We impose the normal on the
incredible and call it the plain truth.
