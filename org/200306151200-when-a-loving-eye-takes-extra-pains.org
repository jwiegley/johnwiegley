#+title: When a loving eye takes extra pains

#+BEGIN_VERSE
If the wind linger
just a moment longer
or the sun shine
a twinkle brighter
the waves lap
a bit more eager
and the sand trail
with extra grains...

It is not that they or I have changed --
but that nature responds
when a loving eye takes extra pains.
