We naturally want religion to be rational, easily comprehended, and
defensible before all arguments, but it has never been so. Some aspects
of God's Will are deeply shrouded in mystery, and will remain forever
beyond our ken.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
How can feeble reason encompass the Qur’án,
Or the spider snare a phoenix in his web?
Wouldst thou that the mind should not entrap thee?
Teach it the science of the love of God!
#+END_EXAMPLE

If reason is to be the highest goal, one must abandon what is beyond
reason; but if one long for the Object of his heart's desire, love is
the only pathway to that region. The mind is a noble and trustworthy
steed, but it should not mount the rider. Look beyond the outward forms
and incongruities and ask: is there a deeper unity within?
