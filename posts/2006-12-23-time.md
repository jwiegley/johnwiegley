| What cup is there more bitter than Time?
| All life's beauty, lain in the dust;
| all tomorrow's hopes, forgotten.
| To our lips we raise a vinegar'd tang,
| where but yesterday, there was wine.
|
| Trust not the deceit of color or song.
| To the eyes, a wondrous thing;
| to the ears, a paean of heaven.
| Already the Puppeteer readies his box,
| where he hides them all before long.
|
| Yet, in the lover's heart lies a secret.
| A knowledge unknown to tongues;
| a truth hidden even from minds.
| That in the heart of pain lies a door,
| one step beyond grief and regret:
|
| That if we had not loved, we should not hurt;
| that if we'd been not warm, we would not shiver.
| All bitterness we taste is in memory of sweet;
| all longing we feel, a proof of union.
|
| For this terrible pain we call our life,
| is knowledge that the soul knows of better.
|
| It is written:
|   "Verily, we are from God,
|   and to Him shall we return."
