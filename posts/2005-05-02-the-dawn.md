    So many things to study, to know,  
    not only a million facts  
    but a million points of view...

    The skies of man's endeavor  
    are filled with countless lights!  
    each standing bold against  
    the empty backdrop of night.

    No one can count them all.  
    Every season brings a new configuration.  
    Run, run to catch up, but they outpace you.

    Then comes the Dawn of understanding.

    The True Orb touches the horizon,  
    Its first rays bringing all to naught;  
    the very meaning of "seeker" vanishes  
    when he enters the presence of the Sought.

    One Light in Heaven,  
    all lesser things be gone,  
    even the blackness between  
    now a glowing shade of blue.

    On that Day, there is only Him.  
    Whatever else had seemed of interest  
    must fall to Heaven's coup.
