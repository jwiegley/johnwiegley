#+BEGIN_VERSE
I have taken Pain into my arms
for a final kiss --
no longer shall it sting me.

But then I wait;
my lips grow dry --
until the anguish of no anguish
overcomes me,
and my arms fly open once again.

It is a pain so sweet
we remember every bitter word!
Burned into our memory
with a flame of love --
ambivalent, yet fierce in meaning.

It is I, the pale shadow,
who feels burnt by the sun;
not I, the blazing glory,
whose rays reach to infinity.
