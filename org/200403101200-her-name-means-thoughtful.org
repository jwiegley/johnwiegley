#+title: Her name means "thoughtful"

#+BEGIN_VERSE
How much do we ponder
the effect we have on each other's lives --
even if it goes no further than a single day,
no deeper than a conversation?

Sometimes, our eyes as we walk away,
or a simple touch,
or laughter,
can mean everything to a person's heart.

What we don't see
is how life prepares us
to understand this.
