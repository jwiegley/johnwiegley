    Cold,  
    in the way of frozen,  
    wasting ice:  
    the arctic's night  
    of every creature  
    running toward the hope  
    of morning light.

    This is,  
    in ways unknown,  
    the landscape of cities  
    filled with men:  
    the white bunny soul,  
    the hunting bear soul,  
    the sleeping seal soul.

    All wait for the day  
    as chill bites the limbs  
    of their fading hope.  
    When comes the day?
