#+BEGIN_VERSE
Tenderly, with your arms around me
  your lips close to my ear
  your head against my shoulder
  your hair on my cheek
  your warmth, surrounding me
  your still, calming air
  your eyes, mostly closed
  your form next to mine
  your breathing, soft and deep
  your quiet silence
  your gentle, stirring touch...

You are everything I dream of
and nothing I can know --
without you here, beside me,
holding me just so...
