    I watch you, my friend,
    your vast belly
    undulating in rhythms
    to some mystic dance;
    your gentle suspirations
    and balming murmurs
    that leave the heart entranced;
    your cold and watery hues:
    now green in the shallows
    now black in the depths --
    where uncounted fathoms
    halt the light's advance:
    I call you the sea --
    but every moment you change.
    You defy my conceptions.
    You swallow whole
    my ships of fancy --
    as you wash away the words
    I write upon your sands.
