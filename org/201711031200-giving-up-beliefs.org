#+title: Giving up beliefs

I think true faith means being willing to give up every one of your
beliefs in the name of truth. Because truth is the truth, and your
beliefs are just... your beliefs. One is absolute and independent, while
the other is relative to what you know, understand and perceive.

This doesn't necessarily mean that one day you'll stop believing in God,
or not God, or whatever is most important to you; but your beliefs about
it should change as you progress in life, because beliefs are, after
all, mostly ideas. The thought that one's beliefs wouldn't change in the
face of new knowledge and experience isn't faith, it's blindness.

Faith is knowing that someone loves you, and is absolutely good, even if
they act in a way that seems 100% the opposite. This is because you have
faith in the person, and so choose to believe that you haven't fully
understood the situation.
