#+BEGIN_VERSE
One night, having reached
the ocean of mystery
I dipped my simple cup

Yes, it was wet
it slaked my thirst
it tasted of the sea
it filled me up...

But there was no royal blue
nor leviathans of the deep
no pearls of great luster
nor place for whales to sleep

To know these, I could not bring
the sea to me
in my familiar cup

Rather must I dive
out beyond the shore
and, losing sight of land,
learn the language of the fishes
in silence her mysteries to keep.
