title: Study for a change of heart
tags: journal
---

The reason why I study most things is not for the knowledge that I might
gain, but from the change of heart -- the maturation of spirit -- which
results. If I read a book, and then shortly after completely forget its
contents, yet if I read it deeply its effect will remain. I may not
remember the characters, but my life will carry that change as a part of
me.

In this sense, perhaps achieving a certain degree of material knowledge
is not so very important -- or thinking that we understand the words of
the Prophet -- but rather that we involve ourselves in those activities
and pursuits which will cause our spirits to grow and develop.
Sometimes, a sunset can do this better than mastering trigonometry.
