    And now I stand before the sea
    of my ever-fluxing possibilities.
    As I step forward, they do not drown me;
    there is no water in my lungs,
    no gasping or struggling --
    no reason to return to the shore.

    With each stride, the walls of resistance
    rise up to my left and my right,
    and my feet know only the hard ground,
    the sure path,
    that can no longer be obscured.
