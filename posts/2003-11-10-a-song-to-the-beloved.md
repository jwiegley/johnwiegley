    I seek someone, but who is she?
    Or rather, who is She?

    In the faces that go by, not a one --
    only inklings.

    Then other times,
    when my heart and my eyes are clear,
    I stop, to dream unholy dreams.

    And in such a dream
    my lover speaks to me:
    she makes the wind to be her voice.

    Her eyes, like stars in the night sky,
    her hair a black moonlight
    that brushes my cheeks.

    For she is that sky,
    that pale and somber moon.
    I call out to her in yearning pleas
    and through my open door she comes.
