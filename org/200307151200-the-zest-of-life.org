#+title: The zest of life

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Pain is the zest of life
and joy
the sweetness of the fruit within.

Whoever's bite is too shallow
and shrinks back
from the bitter, pungent
necessity of contact

Never tastes the full bite,
as teeth sink deep
into a flesh designed
to discourage the casual nibbler.

But if he go
just that little bit further
what a supple, succulent juice
is his reward;

An ambrosia
for those whose knowledge
will not permit
stopping at the first taste.
