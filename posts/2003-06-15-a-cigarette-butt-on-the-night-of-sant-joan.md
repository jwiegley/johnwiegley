    He lays fallen upon the ground,
    victim to a battle
    more die for with every day;
    his worth spent,
    the fiber of his head
    clouded by moody pensations;
    a collar of white,
    crown of dusty gold
    crushed flat
    by the heel that cast him aside;
    and lacking now the breath
    that summoned his end
    to tell of his humble plight --
    he must ever remain unsung:
    a cigarette butt.
