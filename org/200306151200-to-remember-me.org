#+title: To remember me

#+BEGIN_VERSE
If you stray along sandy beaches
throw a stone, to remember me.
The sun is shining without a sound;
the waves, the birds, are louder;
the salty air, sails in the far blue, all nearer;
yet not one thing as bright.
If your foot catches on a stone
throw it, to remember me.
