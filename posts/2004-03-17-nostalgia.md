| I remember sun.
| I remember evening wind, and
| the memory of a pretty girl:
| her name was Nicki.
| The night was filled with demons
| and we lived only for play...
| if only my heart could remember.
|
| I felt the anxiousness of long days
| as time dallied between summers.
| And playing -- such things came naturally.
| If only my mind could remember.
|
| What happened from then until now?
| The blur is too hard to examine.
| I can recall but not account
| for so many days of waiting:
|
| Waiting for now, waiting to question,
| if all that I'm left
| is to remember.
