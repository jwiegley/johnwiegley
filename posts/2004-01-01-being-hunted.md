    What is it
    that hounds me in the dark?
    in the lonely hours,
    in the still and secret places...

    My heart is a hunter
    that stalks my mind.

    I hide in the daylight --
    but when all is quiet
    it still finds me.

    I have heard it said:
    "There is something about
    the dark sanctity of the night
    that beckons me."

    I fully agree.
