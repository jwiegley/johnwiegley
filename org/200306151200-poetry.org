#+BEGIN_VERSE
Poetry is what a man writes
when he is thrilled
by the beauty of his own thought.
Some in music, others in diagrams
or programs, drawings, schematics...

In whatever form
it is a worship of the glory of knowing
and of feeling
and of reaching upward
to capture a ray from heaven's beauty.

Then it can be seen
that God's greatest gift to man
is his intellect.
And man's greatest gift to God --
and to himself --
is to use it.
