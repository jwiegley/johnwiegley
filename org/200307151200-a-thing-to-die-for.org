#+title: A thing to die for

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Without the light
it would not be seen;
without eyes
it would not be seen.

Between these two forms of nothing
a being of phenomenon
neither in the object
or the eye or the light.

But there... a subtle shading of rose
shaped into a smile
beneath eyes
like my own hope given form.

There... what is that shaft
pushing its way into the labors of my heart?
ruining the moment's peace
and offering something
I would live without peace for
day upon day again.

Between two different kinds of void:
a thing to die for.
