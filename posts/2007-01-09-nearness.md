| If a candle approach the Sun,
| how can it complain of its smallness,
| its feebleness, its weakness?
|
| Alone in the dark, it weeps and pines.
| Even it shines -- but to no avail.
| O futile, feeble candle!
| If truly you aim for the Sun,
| how will you complain?
|
| With each step:
| your tears flow stronger
| your light grows weaker
| even your steps will fail...
|
|   For these are the signs of progress!
|
| One who stands before the Sun
| must lose all trace of self --
| but not through effort or intention:
| any more than a runner
| intends to lose his breath.
|
| And when you find the Sun,
| there can be no more sorrow --
| even as your light dims
| and your faculties recede...
|
|   He who finds the Sun knows only glory.
