#+title: Poem of love

My inspired rendering of a poem on love by Na'im Madyun:

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Born of the Spirit:
Love nurtures our spirit;
As the holy light shines
its light in the mind
is that Love Divine.
Love draws us in
A swirl of gravity's
world-embracing drawing-in
of all that is:
the natural way.
Strongest when truth
is most near
and most dear;
a mighty magnet
a lodestone
the Philosopher's Stone
each being in love
is this love becoming known
by pain, through pain,
a cascading rain
that knows no end
to the knowledge.
