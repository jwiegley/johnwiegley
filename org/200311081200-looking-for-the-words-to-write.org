#+BEGIN_VERSE
Today they have all left me:
the everyday words we use with one another,
the everyday thoughts---the worries forever.

I can feel the dreams inside me
struggling to find their way,

Looking for the words to write
that will brush the clouds from the sun.

Then the spring of hope begins
and eyes shine with fire and storm...

Still, no one notices, and the crowds walk by.
But a process has begun
that one day might bloom

Into the kind of words I'm looking for
to write, to express
how many of these dreams are of you.
