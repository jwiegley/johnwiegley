    What is it  
    that hounds me in the dark?  
    in the lonely hours,  
    in the still and secret places...

    My heart is a hunter  
    that stalks my mind.

    I hide in the daylight --  
    but when all is quiet  
    it still finds me.

    I have heard it said:  
    "There is something about  
    the dark sanctity of the night  
    that beckons me."

    I fully agree.
