title: What is philosophy good for?
tags: journal

While most other courses will teach you how to think about a particular
subject, philosophy is unique in that it questions the process of
thinking itself: By what logic do we arrive at answers? What is the
foundation of answers, and the meaning of questions? How is it that we
"know" something? What does it mean to "exist", and what is the
foundation of meaning itself?

Without examining these things you can be quite successful in life, but
you'll always be operating on a base of assumptions about life and
thought that will limit how far you can go in your understanding of it.
If this means nothing to you, you probably don't need any philosophy;
but if you'd like to discover more from life than just eating, sleeping
and death, then it's all the things we hold to be true, automatically
and for granted, that demand our intense scrutiny.
