#+title: A mime

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I watched a mime
think he could paint the sky with his touch;
his hands, dipped in white paint,
drawing strokes that left no imprint.

Unless it was not the air
he meant to reach,
and his canvas
not the emptiness around him...

But the eyes of his watchers,
their little easels of hearts
capturing each vanishing motion
in the fondness of memory.
