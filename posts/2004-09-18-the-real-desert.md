    The real desert
    is a space between the mountains.
    A hollow in the green and watered Earth.

    It stretches out
    and fills with its own emptiness;
    the silence is crowded
    by a thousand unheard things.

    Its song of wind blows and blows
    drifting the sands about.
    I watch the long, lonely dance.
    It is never and always the same.
