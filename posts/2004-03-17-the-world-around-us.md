    To see the summer sun  
    riding on chariots of cloud  
    needs only eyes.

    But feeling the weeping of winter rains  
    is more than bodies of flesh can do.

    When do water drops become tears,  
    or the sun's rays, a kiss of warmth?  
    When is the cold Earth like a gift,  
    bringing forth wonder and beauty and hope?

    What eyes have I? that see in the world of atoms  
    an image to set my soul on fire...

    For somehow:  
      vibration yields sound,  
      energy, color,  
      warmth, love,  
      space, freedom,  
      and on a cold and starry night,  
      the whispers of the soul's vehement longing...

    When did it happen?  
    that a man of such ordinary thoughts  
    found himself everywhere surrounded by Beauty.
