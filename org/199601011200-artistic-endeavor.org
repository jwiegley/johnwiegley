#+title: Artistic endeavor

In pursuit of artistic endeavor, the goal is to capture from an event
the essential element which makes it real for the viewer. Only this
element is conveyed, allowing the remainder -- the "mundane details" --
to be recreated in the audience's mind, by his own creative imagination.
In this way, art can be made "pro-creative".

Because it is not possible to the repeat the real world, nor can the
tree of meaning and significance be transplanted directly from the
artist's mind to the viewer. Instead, a seed of pure, refined substance
is presented -- offered -- and the reconstitution occurs in the reader.
Just as an oak seed, if it is that, will always produce an oak tree.

These things require mastery of the techniques of distilling rich
experience and employing suggestion and subtlety, so that it is brought
into an essential moment, and this moment becomes another real event in
the viewer's mind.
