    They spill like a sea,
    all walking, tan and colored drops,
    into the greater, deeper sea...

    One blue, above, endless from east to west
    but for its radiant Jewel;
    the other, blue, lapping at the sand,
    receiving great hordes --
    this clash of seas, splashing, playing...

    And the boats wander by --
    the arms, the legs! --
    and wander by again.
