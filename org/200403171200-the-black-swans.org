#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sunlight fell on everything,
lighting the palm trees brilliant
that stood in the middle of the lake.

The waters were shaped in rounded pools,
surrounded by cultured lawns
and a chaos of trees and flowers.
While overhead the squawking the fruit bats
reminded me that I was in a foreign country.

But nothing so much as the black swans
gliding through schools of ivory gulls,
standing out beautifully
like carvings of ebony adrift upon the water;
as the others, like fluttering foam,
rose up around them.
