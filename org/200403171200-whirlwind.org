#+title: Whirlwind

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Gathering together its full force
  of howling wind, whipped on
  by the fiercest of riders -- Nature enraged --

It carries on, gorging itself on towns
  of helpless, screaming victims
  tossing aside the endeavors of man
  more easily than a house of cards
  that yields to the furious thump of its master's fist;

All blown aside, digested into small fragments:
  the bones, dust and people's dreams:
  disappeared like the breeze of a dead summer.

  Where are they now?
  And where will I be,
  if such a torrent lay its awful hands on my life?
