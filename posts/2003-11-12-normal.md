| In the town of Normal
| it is all facades.
| There is much of what "should be"
| and little of what is.
| They are very busy there.
| Terribly busy.
| Always an affront if I visit
| unoccupied.
| Facade faces in facade windows,
| with a ready word
| for every traveller's need.
|
| Each day I commute through Normal.
| I ride the express train
| that hurtles on its tracks.
| At the stations, people don't get on;
| they try to hold on,
| to stop the train,
| maybe grab an arm and leg
| and pull you off.
| That it runs at all, that train,
| is its implacable, fury force of locomotion.
| No station facade can hold it back.
| It charges through, heedless, a holy terror,
| an unborn child of speed
| in every pregnant moment.
|
| Sometimes, a person gets on.
| They stare in wide-eyed, deepening wonder
| at the scenes that pass us by.
| The hinterlands, the back-country:
| there's nothing like it in Normal.
| So they sit amazed,
| they gasp and cry.
| And I do the same,
| to welcome them.
