title: A Journey of Faith

I would like to tell story of my encounters with faith. It is a story
with many chapters so far, and I hope many more to come. Perhaps in what
I've gone through, there may be something of interest to others.

In my earliest, pre-cognizant years, I was baptized as a Methodist
Christian, to the dismay of my catholic grandparents. I believe it was
an act of rebellion on the part of my mother. They tell me I handled the
event quite peacefully, except for being stubborn about constantly
pulling on the minister's long mustache. Such was my induction into
faith.

I remember attending several different Christian churches while growing
up, mostly Methodist and Unitarian. All of them were very relaxed -- as
Protestantism goes -- and didn't stress religion too strongly. On the
whole, they were inexpressibly boring. The first step was attending the
sermon, which I could never remember, and had a terrible time sitting
through. Then would come the children's classes, where I did learn a few
useful things. I still remember some of the lessons I learned about the
disciples, and also that hell is a very bad place which I would enter
directly if I ever committed suicide. I must say, that class caused me
to never to consider suicide as an option, whatever my present beliefs
may be.

At one point, our Sunday school teacher told us we should invite Jesus
Christ into our hearts, and that if we did so, He would accept us. This
was when I was about twelve years old, and represents my only active
participation
