Location: 380 Esplanade

    Her tongue is a jagged knife --  
    It saws me.  
    It cuts the little bits  
    that seem too big.

    Why does she need my single world  
      mosaic?  
    So many motley tiles  
    that won't fit neatly.

    She breaks it up --  
    so we breakup --  
    but I still can't  
    find the pieces.
