    I asked a key
    who had found his lock:

      "How did you know?
      What did she say
      to convince you?"

    He looked at me a while,
    then told me:

      "It's wasn't so much
      what she said --
      as what she didn't:

      a seamless joining together;
      a lack of noise
      to proclaim ill-fitting;

      an absence of effort
      where before
      there had always been."
