#+BEGIN_VERSE
I wish I had a switch
that would make English
a foreign language to me.

Then I could watch the faces of people,
bobbing up and down,
and listen to the music of their voices:

The soft tones, mixed with
rich, lustry cooing;
or the staccato whisper of a hushed conversation.

And everything else:
the complaints, rumors, gossip,
and talk of this world;

would transform again into something innocent
and quite uniquely beautiful.
