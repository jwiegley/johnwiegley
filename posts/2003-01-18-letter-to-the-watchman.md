    Your love is so very hard, my friend --
    and so very dear.

    Icicles that rain on my heart
    offer a cool draught
    once the sun of knowing rises;

    Bitter grains of salt
    make finely piquant
    the dishes life sends after;

    Harsh fire -- a great inferno --
    transfigures my iron soul
    into radiant shafts of light...

    So very hard, my friend,
    yet so dear.
