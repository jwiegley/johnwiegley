    Sometimes, a person just wants to remember
    what it feels like to be in love;

    to feel the sun shining on their face,
    to have an inspiration,
    to have you -- if only in their dreams for a while.

    It's like cherishing a memory:
    all the details are there,
    only requital is missing.
