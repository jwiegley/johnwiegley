title: A place along sunset beach

    Where the ever-deepening silence
    collects into quiet pools of sound,
    and the waves of light
    issuing from far-off beacons
    touch my fingertips as I lift them to my face,

    I understand that here is
    a holy place,
    where holy thoughts, and holy deeds,
    have made sacred
    a once ordinary ground.
