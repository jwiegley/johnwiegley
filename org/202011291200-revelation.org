#+title: The Revelation of God

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The Revelation of God is like a curtain
made to be pulled back
to reveal a Loved One
you have longed for all your life
even if you never knew her name.

It exists because
it is not meet and seemly
that such pure beauty
should be revealed to all eyes
avaricious and vulgar.
The heart must be tested, and shown true.

As a veil, it should be seen as a veil.
That is, look for the point of turning
behind each word
how it leads back and connects to Him.
It reveals what it conceals.
