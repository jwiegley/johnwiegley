#+title: Waching a movie

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A movie plays...
Light painted on the wall
Watching intently
I find myself enthralled
What will happen?
What will they do?
The drama unfolds
Each moment new.

Till the final hour
When the lights go dark
And all is blank again
Not a single mark
Everything at once
Returns to blank space
The characters, the pagentry
Everything replaced.

What remains is only...
The effect on my heart
The traces in my mind
Decisions I now make differently
... I leave all the rest behind.
