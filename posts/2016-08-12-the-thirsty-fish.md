I believe that this world is a crucible, within which the pure of heart are
tested, and distinguished from the false and self-seeking.

Everything revolves around the Manifestation of God, and discovering who is
true in their devotion to Him. Is it because they want something from the
exchange, or do they love Him only for the sake of His Beauty?

None of this is to God's benefit. He can dispense with everything. He creates
this opportunity for us, out of perfect Mercy, so that we might, *ourselves*,
discover the value of that recognition.

Imagine a wealthy father who intends to bestow on his child a boundless
inheritance. If the child is going to be without want for the whole of his
life, would it not sweeten his appreciation if he were made to endure poverty
at the beginning of that life, so that he comes to know the value of every
coin? And while doing so, the father discovers which of his sons are pure in
heart, and who only hungers for power and advantage.

All of this is truly a bounty to us, that we might come to *know* God -- a
knowledge like the thirsty and gasping fish who rediscovers the ocean, and not
like those who remain unaware of its existence their whole lives. Just as
knowledge of light requires darkness, and only then can a man appreciate the
magnificent bounty of the Sun's light. If he were born in the neighborhood of
the sun, he would either be blind, or unable to perceive the infinite variety
of colors that potentially dwell within that Light.

Giving people knowledge of the ocean is only one kind of knowledge.
\`Irfán requires, at first, a deep and lasting thirst, so that within a
single drop one may taste the sweetness of the Kawthar fountain.
