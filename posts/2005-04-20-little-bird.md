    I think perhaps
    your heart is a little bird,
    longing to beat its wings
    in the high places,
    to sing and sing
    until Song itself says, "Enough!"

    I sit near you
    and hear the flapping
    of those tiny wings...
    Your body seems to float away.
    If you ran with all your might
    you couldn't catch up
    with that eager heart.

    You are a creature of spirit
    living here for a short while;
    don't ever imagine
    the bars on your cage
    are a part of who you are.

    Fly on, little bird:
    fly on -- until flight becomes you.
