    Leave me to sit by the rutilant flames,
    mesmerized
    having lost every opportunity of success in your world.

    And with my dying breath I shall blow a kiss
    that no one will understand;
    for my last breath is gone now,
    and why?

    Having made "nothing" of myself,
    I am invisible to you.
