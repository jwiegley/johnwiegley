Many seem to think that belief in God should be based on His being obvious and
easily proven to exist. Yet the nature of this life, with all its apparent
contradictions, causes me to wonder if His not being obvious is the point of
why we’re here.

Say you’re the most famous person in all of existence; wouldn’t you like to
know who your real friends are before you let them into your home? As
Hollywood has shown in many films, sometimes you don’t discover who your real
friends are until you test them.
