#+BEGIN_VERSE
The moth is a mystic prince:
one who seeks the light
because he can live no other way.

The moon beckons him
across vast, impossible distances --
yet on he flies
never thinking of his headway.

If he reach a fire
and have nothing for the altar,
he places himself upon the stone
and becomes what he admires.

Only, the moth knows
that love is not enough.
His search will never cease until he blazes
with the same light that he seeks.
