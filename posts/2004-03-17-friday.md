    What human worker bee,
    humming within the drone
    the machine drone
    of corporate America,
    doesn't long for the
    giddy taste of Friday?

    In fact, the week is lost
    dreaming for that day.
    Monday pulls away
    from its heavy glue --
    slowly, drearily --
    while Thursday rushes forth,
    and daydreams leap ahead,
    jumping at the chance
    to play on Friday.

    In fact, we live
    in hope of Friday,
    in loss of Friday,
    wasting our lives
    every day but Friday.

    And on Friday?
    Generally we look to forget it:
    beer, wine, whatever.
    So I guess, ultimately,
    at birth we're already dead.
