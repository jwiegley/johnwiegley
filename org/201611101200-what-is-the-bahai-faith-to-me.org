title: What is the Bahá'í Faith to me?
tags: journal
---

This physical life we are born into is just a beginning: not only of
body and soul, but also our awareness of the nature of existence. The
Bahá'í Faith, to me, is a treasure map telling how to venture through
the wilds of that existence, and discover the hidden cities of gold
lying just beneath the veil of seeming. Virtues are the skills needed to
navigate this path --- truly, it is a journey of the heart --- and
service to others is how I place my feet down on its soil. There is an
essence created whenever unity takes root among a people; and this, I
believe, is when we begin to glimpse the Kingdom of God.
