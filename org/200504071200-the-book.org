#+title: The book

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I awoke to find myself holding a book.
I did not know its language;
I could only look at the pictures,
imagining stories, the way children do.

I began to study, to make an effort
  to crack the code.
After which I noticed: the story had a Plot...

Now I read as one who cannot take time for sleep!

That book was my life, my world;
my understanding: what Your words finally taught me.
