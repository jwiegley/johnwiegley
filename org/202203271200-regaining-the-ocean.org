#+title: Regaining the ocean

A wave is a creature of zero thickness, zero depth. It neither dives nor
departs. It's "not really there", except as a moving form given passing
life by time. It has form due to the ocean, while the ocean is the lone
reality. All the wave has to do is stop asserting its existence, or
striving to regain companionship with the ocean. In a moment, there it
is, a tacit understanding, and all is settled with nothing achieved.
