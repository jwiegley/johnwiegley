title: Why don't prayers work?
tags: journal

Prayer is a mystery; it's not like withdrawing money from an ATM.
Sometimes it's working when you think it isn't, and vice versa.

It's better to use prayer as a means to connect your heart with God, and
express yourself to Him, than treating it like God's IT department.

Prayer is like that feeling you get in the midst of a gorgeous moment
when you say to yourself, "I wish this would never end." The fact that
it does end is part of what made it special; it's not a failure of the
wish.
