#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sometimes, only poems will do.

The words as they meet the paper
sing with a subtle voice,
a quiet, ringing tone
that resounds in the heart:
this is poetry.

So I lift my pen, my wand
and conjure fair spells
to entrance the heart
and grant the power to fly...

Poetry is a doorway to impossible lands.
