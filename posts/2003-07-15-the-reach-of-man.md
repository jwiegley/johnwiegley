    Look up there, at the clouds;  
    look still higher  
    to the white moon  
    passing along the course  
    of a sunlit day.  
    And to the bright stars  
    that are only planets:  
    Jupiter and Venus,  
    the ruddy glow of Mars.

    These are the places man has gone to,  
    when no other creature would;  
    his eye itself, or an eye  
    fashioned after his own design.

    Look up into the skies of blue  
    knowing that your kind of mind,  
    your type of eye and foot,  
    has reached beyond the steady grasp of Earth  
    and kicked up dust  
    on the face of that placid moon.
