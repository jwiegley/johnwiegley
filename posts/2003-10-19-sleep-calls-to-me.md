| Although sleep calls to me with a sweet voice,
| I cannot answer.
| To close my eyes, and weep soft tears with Her
|   in form of dreams
| would need a readiness to awaken
| I cannot master.
|
| Tease me not, my Love,
| by your soft caresses
| in shape of pillows and thread.
| I know the land you call me to:
| is it not for mortals to tread?
|
| My eyes close gently now
| on world and wondering both;
| perhaps these words, from a pensive heart,
| may find you, and keep you,
| and bind you to me in troth.
