    Adrift... so terribly adrift.  
    Ever blown and reconfigured:  
    never the same.

    As white as the pallor of death;  
    dry, unfeeling,  
    moving about with a purpose all their own.

    So much activity,  
    so little result.  
    Moving here and there, only to move back;  
    today a valley, tomorrow a dune.

    Their vastness draws out from me all that I have  
    and replaces nothing.  
    Not even the sign that my efforts are worthwhile.

    And now they bury me,  
    these desert sands,  
    since I have become just as lifeless as they.
