title: The black swans

    Sunlight fell on everything,
    lighting the palm trees brilliant
    that stood in the middle of the lake.

    The waters were shaped in rounded pools,
    surrounded by cultured lawns
    and a chaos of trees and flowers.
    While overhead the squawking the fruit bats
    reminded me that I was in a foreign country.

    But nothing so much as the black swans
    gliding through schools of ivory gulls,
    standing out beautifully
    like carvings of ebony adrift upon the water;
    as the others, like fluttering foam,
    rose up around them.
