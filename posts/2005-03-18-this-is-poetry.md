    Sometimes, only poems will do.

    The words as they meet the paper
    sing with a subtle voice,
    a quiet, ringing tone
    that resounds in the heart:
    this is poetry.

    So I lift my pen, my wand
    and conjure fair spells
    to entrance the heart
    and grant the power to fly...

    Poetry is a doorway to impossible lands.
