#+title: Levels of awareness

It seems strange, but there appear to be at least two levels of
awareness going on inside me. Remember how I had said I did not know
myself, and what I genuinely wanted? Well, it appears that at another,
more subconscious level, I /do/ know what I want; and I think it's the
immaturity of these desires -- a childlike fantasy, really -- that helps
to prevent them from coming to light.

It's strange. It's the sort of things where if you examine yourself
within a single day, you can't see it; but when you extend the
perspective to cover weeks or months, then a faint, but definite pattern
begins to emerge. It's like my consciousness directs my daily plans, but
this hidden aspect of myself governs the overall outcome. And to a fated
degree, as if it must happen. I have an Indian friend who would call
this "being".

But here is an example: In my interactions with people I'm often not
"planning" things, as if I had some ulterior motive. But when I stand
back and look at my interactions with that person over a long period of
time, I notice some definite scheming going on -- as if I'd known what I
wanted all along, before conscious of it.

And the scheming is carried out so well sometimes that it seems entirely
incongruous to my everyday self. Not at all as shy or hesitating; more
like some brooding mastermind determined to have his way, and also to
convince everyone that that was the way it must naturally have been.

And this quality of its being the seemly evident outcome makes it either
sinister, or magical, depending on your point of view. This subconscious
awareness is what seems to be able to read people's thoughts, and react
in just that way which would eventually produce the result desired.
Strange, brooding and dark. Invisible except for the remote view. Like
chaos, until the underlying order is discovered.
