    The sun is warm today;
    the breezes are cool.
    Soft clouds embrace the light
    and acquire a radiant glow...

    The afternoon passes slowly.
    Children are playing on the grass.
    It's been hours since I last wondered
      what time it was --
    hours since I thought, instead of lived...

    I wonder: Will You come join me
    here on the green grasses?
    Then I recall the sun,
    the breeze, the clouds, the day...

    When have You ever not been with me?
