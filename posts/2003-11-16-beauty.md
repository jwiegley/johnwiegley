    If I speak of sadness and sorrowful weeping,
    lachrymose wandering,
    clutching at my heart --
    perhaps I refer to the beauty of its reality.

    Or loneliness.  Although empty beyond thought,
    vacant like the winter, without warmth,
    a terrible disease of struggling --
    yet is it a real thing, an honest thing.

    Such purities burn away
    the heavy sackcloth
    that hides the face of beauty.
