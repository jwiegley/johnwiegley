    Leave me alone --  
    to walk through the streets  
      unhurried, unhindered,  
    placing each foot deliberately;  
    feeling the weight of my body  
    as it rocks back and forth.

    Kids thirst to get through school  
      and find a job.  
    What a useless waste!  
    if one doesn't understand why he does it.

    The world doesn't encourage  
    time off to think about these things.  
    They'd prefer to notice the parachute  
    ten thousand feet from the valley floor  
    and falling...
