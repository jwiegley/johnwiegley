I feel your peace on quiet nights
when the cool winds presage rain.

Later your joy rises, with its gentle warmth
to dry the dewdrops weighing the leaves.

Your beauty sings like songbirds on branches
or crickets pleading with the star-filled night.

Your bright qualities are indeed my Charon:
for their sublime touch ferries me to other worlds.
