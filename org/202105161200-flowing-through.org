#+BEGIN_VERSE
Looking at the self,
which at first appears
to be a constant entity
moving through time,
we discover it's more
of a standing wave form:
no "self" that persists --
only actualized by water
ever flowing through.
What is there to "be" enlightened?
Nor does the Ocean ever cease
its surge and flow.
