One analogy that makes the concept of both requiring and abandoning patience
in the mystic path make sense is human love. When a young man or woman wishes
to find their "true love", one of the things we more experienced people tell
them is not to rush into anything. That is, don't hook up with the first
willing person you meet. In their sheer desire to be wed/joined, a person is
likely to jump at the first feelings of affection, thinking, "Omg, I'm never
going to find real love, I should take what I'm able to find." They look at
examples of older, single people all around them, and think that it's such a
rare occurrence, they should be lucky to find anything.

But seeking out the Manifestation comes with a guarantee of victory. However,
one should not seize upon whatever belief seems appealing. Just as we might
counsel the prospective lover, patience is required. When you find your true
love, you'll know. If you're not sure, then you haven't yet. Don't let your
heart tie you down prematurely, because attachment is in its nature. Observe
patience and continue the search, anywhere and everywhere. The surest path to
romantic fulfillment is exposure to as many people as possible, combined with
prayer and readying one's self for the day they find it. So too with our
Immortal Bride. Since we can't force the issue, our energy should be spent
preparing ourselves for recognizing Him on the day God leads us to victory.

As for impatience, the sign of true love is uncontrollable desire. Think about
when you studied subjects in college. Some were boring, some mildly
interesting, some thought provoking. But if you were lucky enough -- and if,
again, you exposed yourself to enough subjects -- you may have been lucky to
find that one subject which resonates with your mind and heart. Whose study
lit your mind on fire and kept you up late at night; whose study was both
satisfying and thirst-producing, because the more you delved into it the
greater your desire became.

Patience is needed to find such a subject. Impatience is the sign that you
have found it. But it must never be the premature impatience of "just wanting
the search to be over with". One must be willing for the search to endure over
ten thousand years. That proves one's dedication. Until your Beloved "seizes
the reins of patience and reserve from out thy hand", then the search must
continue.
