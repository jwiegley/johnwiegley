    A mood of night
    settles on the trees,
    on the satin of dark waters,
    on the rocks and the creatures
    of the watery deep.

    The moon is a bold eye
    watching the land of evening;
    sewing by his regard
    tiny pearl-drops of light
    that tempt the oyster's envy.

    And in the far-off, apace:
    an isle of moonlight
    drifts beneath the silent glow,
    a carpet of lambent silver
    against the mood of night.
