#+title: Writing haiku

The formula is simple: It follows a similar philosophy to the Chinese
paintings of the Ming(?) dynasty. The goal is to paint a picture of
what's missing, so that the unsaid element is perceived more directly
than the words. So, imagine something you want to describe, then remove
the main element you wish to convey. Then, find a combination of words
which makes this omission glaring. That "glaring" quality will provoke
the sense of astonishing beauty that we feel from good haiku.

I am finding there is a difference between merely "short poems" and
"haiku". If we define haiku as provoking that startling element of
sudden understanding, like standing in a room and realizing of a sudden
that no one is male. I think this is the reason why Zen loves it, in
fact since koan and zazen are aimed at the same experience. Good haiku
is a good /experience/.
