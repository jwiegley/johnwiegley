#+BEGIN_VERSE
I shall cast upon the mountains --
  as a clarion call! --
the name of my Beloved;
and commit to paper
such tales of loving mention,
all will be astonished.

Whatever names you knew of Love
before this -- forget them!

The beating of every lover's heart
will be the sound of my communion.
