#+title: Right now

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Only when I think I have something
can I fear losing it.
Only when I think I know something
can I doubt knowing it.

For having and not having are absolutes,
as is knowing and not knowing.
Any feeling of need to think on it --
is its own answer.

Don't try to know what you don't;
don't extend the concept of possession.
In your own hands, right now,
is the only fact:
and what your heart is sure of,
right now
is the only knowledge.
