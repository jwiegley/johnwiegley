#+BEGIN_VERSE
Look up there, at the clouds;
look still higher
to the white moon
passing along the course
of a sunlit day.
And to the bright stars
that are only planets:
Jupiter and Venus,
the ruddy glow of Mars.

These are the places man has gone to,
when no other creature would;
his eye itself, or an eye
fashioned after his own design.

Look up into the skies of blue
knowing that your kind of mind,
your type of eye and foot,
has reached beyond the steady grasp of Earth
and kicked up dust
on the face of that placid moon.
