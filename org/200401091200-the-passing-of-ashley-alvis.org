title: The passing of Ashley Alvis
tags: journal
---

I learned this evening that my friend, and companion on the mystical
path, Ashley Alvis, passed away from a heart attack in his home in
Atlanta, Georgia. Ashley is one of the few souls I'd met who embodied
both joy and mystical passion to an extreme degree. I will miss his
words of wonder -- though on deeper levels I think we are more connected
now than before.

I was speaking to a friend about Ash, who made the comment that he now
felt "beyond the veil" due to his passing. This caused me to reflect on
the nature of this life, and how sometimes it seems that the real veil
is not the one between life and death, but the obscuring perceptions
that divide us when we seem, outwardly, to be nearest. Like a mystical
paradox, those who seem near can be the most far, while those now gone
may be the most present of all.
