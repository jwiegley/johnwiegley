    It led the way before me:
    cool, and dark
    an unending ribbon of night
    stretching to meet the horizon.

    Its waters had captured an image of heaven --
    toying with its lights,
    setting the stars to dancing
    and making of the moon
      a disk of liquid silver.

    What fish gathered below,
    I wondered?
    what denizens of the mighty river
    to contemplate my evening ride?

    Yet the boat leapt on, quick prow
    slicing through the splashing black;
    my face catching the wind
    and those untamed waters, my soul.
