#+BEGIN_VERSE
The wind whispers secrets
ears cannot hear,
its magics unknown to a
"heart possessed by fear".

Gird up your faith!
Walk on those waves!
Find the hidden Gem
that hides before your eyes...

For the moment is precious
and the days are short;
soon, this grand movie
will play to its end.

So listen again --
listen a thousand times! --
to that coy, coquettish wind...
and when you hear its answer:
Ascend.
