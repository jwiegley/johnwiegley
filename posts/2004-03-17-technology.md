    Where is the ode's cry,
      or the eagle's stare of wonder?

    The world of things has caught me up
      on a river running rapidly,
    making everything around me a blur, and myself
      anxious of what's coming next.

    Years ago I made friends with the shadows on my wall,
    heard dreams in the rustling of the wind,
    and remembered everything with a sharpness
      that made my eyes water.

    And now, friends are hard to come by,
    dreams are forgotten,
    and memories -- are only a memory.

    Perhaps "benefit" is a word
    whose meaning we've considered poorly.
