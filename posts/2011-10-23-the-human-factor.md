When we set out to comprehend Truth, our greatest barrier is the mind we do so
with.  Like the eyes our mind is bounded by its own limitations, such that
whatever we see is shaped by them.  So if our brain is something like a cookie
cutter for ideas, ultimately it means everything sort of looks like a cookie.

An example of this occurred to me the other day.  It's just a thought
experiment, but I think it reveals the nature of the Human Factor very
clearly:

Imagine you have ten twenty-sided dice in front of you.  (If anyone reading
this is (or was) a D&D player, I'm sure you have plenty of twenty-side dice
just laying around!)  Imagine that you have ten of these dice, and that you
gather them up in your hands...

Now throw the dice, watching the random numbers fall.  Then throw them again,
and again.  Each time, it's a different pattern.

Now, think very carefully, and imagine how you might feel if suddenly, all ten
dice came up 20s.  Every single one.  What would be your reaction?  Perhaps
you'd think it was a joke; or that the dice were rigged; or maybe something
miraculous had happened?

The odds that all the numbers will come up 20 in a such a dice throw is over
one in a trillion.  Assuming you picked up and threw these dice every minute,
without stopping, you'd have to wait (on average) about 325,000 years before
you'd ever see all the numbers turn up 20.

Now, our humanity is a bit sneaky, but here's how the Human Factor has
revealed itself: If you try out this experiment, odds are you'll see a bunch
of random numbers from the dice, just as you did at the beginning of the
thought experiment.  But the mathematical fact is: *every pattern you'd see
is exactly as rare as throwing all 20s*.  This means you could throw dice for
almost half a million years before you'd ever see the same pattern twice.

The Human Factor is that we presume relevance.  For some reason, we're amazed
and shocked when we see all the numbers turn up the same, but we discount as
"meaningless" a set of jumbled numbers.  Yet in the realm of dice throwing,
there is no distinction *at all* between the two outcomes.  Every throw is
equally as likely, and therefore equally as rare.  It's we, as humans, we
place value on a specific outcome over and above the rest.

Likewise in reality, I believe there are many unique truths, but only a
handful that are astonishingly unique.  Most appear to us as a random jumble,
and so we pass them right by.  The question is, how do we stop ourselves from
rigging our perception of the outcome's merit?
