    There came a day  
    when the blood in my veins  
      turned to wine:  
    now I am always drunk;

    When my eyes filled  
      with a special light:  
    now I cannot see darkness;

    When my waking life  
      became as a dream:  
    now I am always soaring...

    These things happened slowly  
      and then quickly  
    the way a flower grows  
    for weeks and weeks  
    and one day suddenly blooms.

    There is no one who is not growing  
    toward their heart's fulfillment.

    Turn to the Sun,  
    drink the bountiful rains,  
    strive to push through that  
      weighing soil...

    The rest will happen of itself.
