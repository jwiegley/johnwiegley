#+title: A drop of wisdom

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Ask the lover for a drop of wisdom
and he will cry out tears unearthly wise;

He will tell you happiness is impossible --
that his life is not his to live...

For when She tosses her flowing hair
oceans crash on sandy shores
and he is flung on rocks again and again.

Her eyelashes move in a simple motion
covering and revealing whole worlds to his view --
yet remain forbidden to explore.

Her voice cannot be pictured here;
such blasphemy is not allowed.

The lover's silence is his deepest testimony.
His crying agony, the wails of pain,
the moaning that denies all existence --
can be heard so clearly
from his heart that speaks no sound.
