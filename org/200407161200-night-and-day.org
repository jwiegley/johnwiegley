#+title: Night and Day

#+BEGIN_VERSE
If all the world is perfect
within a grander scheme,
tomorrow's bitter cup
is sweeter than it seems.

If eyes be taught this Way
of seeing past the veil,
they'd find an end to pain;
so would happiness prevail!

For darkness hasn't essence
to bear against the Light;
whose first arrows of dawn
are fatal to the night.

Until they ask:
Mustn't night, too, succeed day?
To which I answer:
The Sun never sets;
  it's the Earth that turns away.
