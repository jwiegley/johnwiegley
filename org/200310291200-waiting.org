#+BEGIN_VERSE
Waiting for the tips of trees
to bow at your arrival...
waiting.

Waiting for the sun's light
to reflect your longing gaze...
waiting.

Waiting for the phone to ring --
a letter, a foot-fall...
waiting.

Waiting in a depth of silence
that drowns my expectations...
waiting.

Waiting for the moon to shine,
but not so bright
as that face near mine...
waiting.

Waiting for you, if you haven't understood --
waiting for you.
