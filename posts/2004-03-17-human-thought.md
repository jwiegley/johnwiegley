    Human thought is a parade of ignorance:  
    our mind begets the shadows on the cave's wall:  
    what does it mean to go forth into the light?

    When we bow in reverence, the mind is stilled,  
    and only the feelings of the heart fill time.  
    Who is the speaker in that silence?

    There is a self behind our thoughts, maybe a "not self",  
    in which every mystery is hidden by rays of light.

    As these unfold, a brightness awakens the mind;  
    thus, through blindness, we first come to know the truth.
