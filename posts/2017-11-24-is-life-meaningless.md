title: Is life meaningless?

Keep in mind that, as children, “play” was totally meaningless too. It had no
societal benefit, no ultimate effect. We played, it ended, so what was the
point?

As conscious beings, our reality is to *be conscious*. It does not necessarily
require a higher moral value, or an ultimate destination. If being aware is
all we can truly possess or achieve, then the goal should be to refine our
acute appreciation of what life has to offer, and the nature of things,
however impermanent — maybe even because they’re impermanent.

Why do this, if everything is transient and perishing? Because. I think you’re
brushing up against a meaning of enlightenment here: Being has its own truth,
which the wanderings of mind will never fathom.
