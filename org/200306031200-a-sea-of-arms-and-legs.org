#+BEGIN_VERSE
They spill like a sea,
all walking, tan and colored drops,
into the greater, deeper sea...

One blue, above, endless from east to west
but for its radiant Jewel;
the other, blue, lapping at the sand,
receiving great hordes --
this clash of seas, splashing, playing...

And the boats wander by --
the arms, the legs! --
and wander by again.
