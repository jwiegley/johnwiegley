#+title: The path of knowledge

#+BEGIN_VERSE
First, He beckons you, to see if you will come;
then He hides from you, until you seek Him;
then He holds you back, until you brave His trials;
then He robs you of joy, until you rejoice with Him;
then He gives you pain, until you know its pleasure;
then He shuns you, until you wait beyond the door;
and then He scorns you, until you want nothing more.

At last, He bestows on you all you have ever wanted,
to know in the end: was it truly Him?
