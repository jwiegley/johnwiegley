title: The soul and perfection

The soul can love only perfection.  But first it must learn how to
recognize perfection.  When it begins seeing it in life, it falls in
love with that essential Quality.  And what it has fallen in love with,
loves the soul in return: Faith dawns that these two may become
reunited.  That faith is empowered by choice, with education providing
the moral guide to the choices that will lead toward, and the choices
that will lead away.  That good choices draw us near is guaranteed, as
with the opposite -- and so justice is born.  As the process continues,
the soul comes alive, and opens its eyes -- to see with His.  The
purpose of life is to test souls to awaken, so that after death they may
take their place, as tokens of divine beauty and grace.
