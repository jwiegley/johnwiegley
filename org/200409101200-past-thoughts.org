#+title: Past thoughts

Before the advent of blogging, I used to jot my thoughts on paper in
composition books. I've finally gathered these past entries together
into a kind of [[file:early][historical blog]]. It may have nothing more
than sentimental value, but it's there if anyone is interested. The
entries range from 1997 until 2003, although since I no longer know the
actual dates, none are given.
