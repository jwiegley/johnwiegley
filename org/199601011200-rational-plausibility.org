#+title: Rational plausibility

Rational plausibility is a hermenuetical technique of interpreting
religious scripture by inventing a scheme whereby the madness of it
seems less mad. This means inventing a metaphor, or analogy or argument,
that simply shows that the thought is conceivable in some contact --
however fictional -- and thus points the road to further elucidation. If
anything, it is a way of at least palliating the mind, to give the soul
a chance to feel, and might exchange inspiration for sheer
consternation. In this sense, it is not a tool for furthering
understanding, so much as it is a technique for discovering moments of
spiritual upliftment, which may often be themselves the real key to
understanding.
