    We have always sought Truth.
    But the terrible irony is:
    In its pursuit, we haven't its aid.

    That is: We cannot use
    a Truth we do not know
    to measure those we think we've found.

    Thus history is replete
    with such cases of irony;
    of believing we already know
    the name, or the face
    of Whom we seek.

    We imagine it will come
    from kings or royal lineage;
    when it appeared from a carpenter
    of unknown descent.

    Or we believe it can be told
    by learned men and scholars;
    when it came from a desert nomad,
    illiterate and cast out.

    We look to men of virtue
    or a proven character;
    when deliverance came
    from the hands of a killer.

    Or we long for personages
    of fame and great reknown;
    when the final word
    was the word of a prisoner.

    If history has taught us anything:
    In matters of Truth and wisdom,
    never trust your expectations.
