    How can I say if I love God more,
    or you, my dear friends?

    When I want to hear Him laugh,
    I tell you the joke.

    When I want to ease His pain,
    I offer you the balm.

    Whenever you smile, I see Him;
    whenever you sigh, I hear Him:

    For if He is the Light
    and you are His candles,

    I need add but a spark of love --
    and suddenly He appears.
