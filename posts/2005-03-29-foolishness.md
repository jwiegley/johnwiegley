    Writing these lines is foolish.  
    Does a beautiful woman ask for a kiss?

    Do the thirsty need prompting to drink  
    or the lonely a reason to open their arms?

    As the ink dries, it chastises me:  
      Those who can understand me need no words  
      and those who need my words cannot understand me.

    The goal is within your reach: *take it!*  
    Why keep pushing it away?

    Every complaint  
    every harsh word  
    every sigh of despair  
    is a hand, repulsing the arms of God.

    His gift is the very Creation  
    some wish to leave.

    Who leaves a party in search of the party?  
    Madness!

    And if they ask:  
      How can you be so happy all the time?

    I would say:  
      As long as that question makes sense to you  
      my answer never will.
