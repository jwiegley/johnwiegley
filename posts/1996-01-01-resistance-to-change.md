The things we try to change in ourselves are resistant to that change,
because we make the attempt.  This very effort is where they derive
their energy.

Our motive for change is the active shape of our fears, because we
believe that if we don't change, acceptance will never occur.  And yet,
the act of seeking change conveys the very lack of acceptance we fear!
Thus is breeds itself, and feeds on its own energy.  When the impulse to
change disappears, then the fear also does, and the desired object is
achieved.  So why would it matter if we change or not?
