#+BEGIN_VERSE
In a pause, to remember my life,
It seems such a crazy jumble of nothing
Headed inexplicably toward what must be something.

And the daydreams -- those glances of light --
Are my hope of what Joy might be when it finally finishes resting.

"I've had my heart broken until now,"
I say to that far-away girl of my dreams,
"Do you know what it'll take to fix it?"

"No, what?", she says,
Her eyes alive with the future.

"Oh, nothing," I say,
"Just that you're there to see me through it."
