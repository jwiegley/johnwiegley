As long as we keep baking with poisoned flour, the act of feeding humanity
will not have the final, desired result.

What I mean to say that we can go through all the right motions, but if our
motives, and the spirit with which we act, still bears feelings and attitudes
of prejudice, a sense of superiority, a tendency to be exclusive, etc., then
the society that results from those efforts will continue to have the ills of
the Old World embedded within it, and thus it will not be — cannot be! — the
future envisioned for us by Bahá’u’lláh.
