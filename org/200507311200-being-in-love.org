#+BEGIN_VERSE
How do I know I'm in love?

If her touch steals time
and her breathing slows it
but her absence makes it long.

If her thoughts of me
are how I know myself,
her lips blurring right and wrong.

If my heart is her creation:
her smile saving me, he frown destroying me --
a gate to both world in her eyes!

If faced by the road of self-destruction
careless, I court my soul's demise.
