title: The truth we know
tags: journal

The truth we know is a concept, a proof that something is well-defined
based on what we're willing to accept.

An "apple" is not true, nor does it exist. It's a name for what you hold
in your hand. For example, you may think that the apple occupies a
clearly defined space, but our ability to smell is because its molecules
permeate the surrounding air. The distinction between "apple" and “not
apple“ is chosen based on the senses, not what evidently is.

Scientific evidence is used to confirm or deny our theories about
physical reality. It doesn't "tell" us anything about realities outside
of human awareness and understanding. Sometimes a discovery will point
to something we don't see yet, and this expands our vision, but never
has a phenomenon explained to us what the universe is, or why it behaves
the way it does.

Common-sense truths are shorthands and many of them are wrong in greater
contexts. The appearance of objects likewise is a function of time, of
probabilities in electro-static tension. We impose the normal on the
incredible and call it the plain truth.
