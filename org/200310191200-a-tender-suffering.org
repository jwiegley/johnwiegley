#+title: A tender suffering

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A tender suffering, you once taught me --
your eyes the lesson, your smile the book;

It was a tale unlike the songs of heaven
that the choir boys whisper in their nook;

Of sweet death you then instructed me,
and the truth of longing's demise:

That to love another One so deeply
is a pain only union can deny...
