    There is a wilderness underfoot
    and I hear the branches crunching...
    Somewhere, the deer are watching me,
    in soft, silent contemplation.

    There is a shore nearby;
    the hush of waves draws closer.
    It leaves me wondering only:
    when will my pilgrimage end?

    Along the way, in this exile,
    sunlight survives through the branches
    In muted forms that cast a glow upon the trees.
    And the mosses, they point me north.

    Here and there there are clearings;
    and once even I found my way to a spring.

    They tell me a City lies beyond,
    just at the edge of the blue and the green,
    on fine sands where forest leads to ocean.

    I trek on, ever watchful.
    It could be I am just around the bend.
