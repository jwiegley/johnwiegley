#+BEGIN_VERSE
There is no greater barrier in our journey
than the boundaries of self.
It is a prison whose walls we cannot break,
since our own desire strengthens them.

We are the narrators of our existence,
deeply believing in the stories we tell ourselves:
a shadow world pulled over the eyes;
a mirage of imagination.
