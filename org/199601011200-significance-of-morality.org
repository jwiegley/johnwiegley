#+title: Significance of morality

Why morality may be significant: In life there seem to be two essential
processes: transformation and transcendence. Where transformation is the
progression, quantitatively of a quality a thing has; whereas
transcendence is the transformation of the qualities themselves, such as
water into gas. When something continues to change according to
transformation, often this will lead to a transcendence, like heating of
water, or magnetizing metal.

Likewise, morality may change our behavior in this manner, changing us
incrementally toward a transcendence of condition that may lead to
entirely different modes of being.
