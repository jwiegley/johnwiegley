| A soul can laugh a hundred times
|   never hearing the joke.
| He sees the painting in the artist's mind.
| In each pen he reads a book.
| To him, autumn is trees falling on the ground,
| and spring is when children are born.
|
| At a single word he hears the speech.
| After a sentence he closes the book.
| Each second winds up the day -- yesterday --
| chasing its tail in fiery, golden circles
|   amidst the clouds.
|
| As past and future grow intimate
|   before his seeing eyes,
| he draws up the sofreh of Time,
| binds it in knots of perception,
| and makes it into a ball, a fist,
| a point.
