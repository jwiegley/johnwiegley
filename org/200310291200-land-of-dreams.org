#+BEGIN_VERSE
Leave me to sleep
so that I never wake again.

The sky becomes violet
the gentle sun wearies
my eyes weep quietly
I am home.

The dark colors of the horizon
the soft sands of the beach
the lullaby waves
welcome me home.

Take me to the land of dreams
the shores of the isle Naught
leaving the world behind
for everlasting sleep.
