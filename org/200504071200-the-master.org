#+BEGIN_VERSE
When the Master appears
is a time
for questions and answers:
  Your questions,
  His answers.

Do not presume
to know in His presence;
do not even imagine
you know what Knowledge is.

Bow to your Sensei!!

If he says you're hungry,
feel your stomach growl;
let His words
become your reality.

As long as you consider Him
with your eyes
you see a feeble man;

As long as He looks at you
with His
He gives His counsel.
