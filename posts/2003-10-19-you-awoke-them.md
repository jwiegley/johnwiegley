    My sadness falls in sweetened drops
    for thought of you provokes them;

    If not these tears, I had not known,
    what form of love evokes them;

    My heart is stilled, its fires gone --
    it waits your Hand to stoke them...

    Now listen close and hear my pains:
    I'd no such joy, till you awoke them.
