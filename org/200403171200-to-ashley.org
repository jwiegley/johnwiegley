#+title: To Ashley

#+BEGIN_VERSE
That's the story,
told by a lover's whimpers in the night,
a remembrance of times past, before past, --
alone in the unseen depths of pre-existence.

Now born, alight with fire like a lambent urge of light,
seeking out our Guide's true Lamp -- Father of All --
Oh lonely candle!

“How can utter nothingness
gallop its steed in the field of pre-existence?”

Or the fleeting shadow, me,
give account before the everlasting Sun...?

To poems I grant the like --
the poetry of my heart --
the cries of an oft-perturbèd soul.

Come my friend, let the night address us
one last time
before the End.
