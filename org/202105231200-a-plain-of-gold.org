title: A plain of gold

The reality is that I'm standing on a plain of gold, with a golden
shovel, looking out through eyes and mind of gold. Dig anywhere, and I
should find it. But I see dirt, always dirt, and then the question comes
up: Where is it?

It's not really that I need to find the right spot to dig: but an
experience that jars my vision sideways. What shape that takes is
entirely dependent on me, my background, my mental state. Hard to invent
that ingredient on my own, though not impossible.

So the digging, in this abused analogy, isn't for the purpose of finding
but a catalyst for realizing there's nothing lost. To hone doubt until
the ringing of a stone is enough, and suddenly, X marks the ever-present
spot.
