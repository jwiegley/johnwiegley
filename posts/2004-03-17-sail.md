    Sails full, reaching out,
    leaving the world of people
    far enough behind to miss them.

    The landscape is ever the same,
    maintaining its similitude
    though I've gone a hundred miles since.

    The secrets she has to tell, this sea:
    a patient listener, far deeper than
    the querying blue eyes
    that wait for me back home.
