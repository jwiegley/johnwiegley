#+title: Summer in Tempe

#+BEGIN_VERSE
What a fierce sun stares at me today.

The roads shimmer in the air;
the lizards alone enjoy it.

Through my tinted lenses
I watch the girls go by...

Everyone talks of Fall
as if Spring had never been.

The cup of water in my hand
is already warm!

Summer, in Tempe, Ariona.
