    Beneath me, far below, the small houses  
    are like memories of a model landscape:

    The motionless blue of the ocean seems painted on,  
    the buildings are too neatly arranged,  
    the roads with their little cars  
    might as well be battery operated.

    Level with my sight is the hearth-fire of the Pacific sunset;  
    and the cloud cover is a cottony blanket  
    laying to rest all the tiny people  
    in their tiny homes below.
