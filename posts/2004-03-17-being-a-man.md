| At times the pain of life is such that not living would be easier.
| And at times the joy of life is too great to bear, and dying would be a relief.
|
| Between the two, which are as directions left and right, I am always moving:
| One foot falls to the left, the other to the right: walking between extremes.
|
| Always the motion of my feet is repeated -- left, right, left, right --
| Describing the progression of a continual, forward movement.
|
| Between the joys that are too ineffable,
| and the pains that are too indescribable, life goes on.
| Like an albatross on some days, plunging my feet thickly into the mud,
| Pulling, straining, only to fall over into the next situation.
|
| Or am I a turtle, making his way slowly,
| or a lion ferociously stalking his prey?
| Do I bound like a gazelle, or creep like a weasel?
| Perhaps I beg my food from the ground like a swine sniffing out his truffles.
|
| And yet some days I am a man, gazing out into the open West where there is only sea.
| I go on walking until the waters rise about me, and hold me back,
| and I am borne into an entirely new form of being.
