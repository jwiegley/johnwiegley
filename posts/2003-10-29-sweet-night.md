    Alone, the night too black --  
    did a tear grace my upturned face?  
    or the mistake of a passing cloud.

    Forgetful, I wander through memories  
    of friends, loves, joys gone by;  
    but the night is so cold, and morning far away...

    Questions hurt, too sore questions,  
    rubbing raw at my heart's cage;  
    then a new moon rises, invisible, yet powerfully fey;

    But strength finds no home in me, no hope!  
    A sigh is all I have left to give  
    as the night's wind carries my last tear away.
