#+title: Favorite movies and songs

Wrote up a [[file:GoodMovies][list of my favorite movies]]. If you have
recommendations for ones I may have missed, please send me an e-mail
(see "Send comments" link in the sidebar).

I've also put up my [[file:playlist][playlist of favorite songs]].

And one more favorite, a verse from the play /Agamemnon/:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Let good prevail!  So be it!
Yet, what is good?  And who
Is God?  How name him, and speak true?
If he accept the name that men
Give him, Zeus I name him then.
I, still perplexed in mind,
For long have searched and weighed
Every hope of comfort or of aid:
Still I can find
No creed to lift this heaviness,
This fear that haunts without excuse --
No name inviting faith, no wistful guess,
Save only -- Zeus.
#+END_EXAMPLE
