    The longing of a lover's eyes,
    draped in fire,
    fanned by the agony of time;
    neither sleep, nor food,
    only the sublimity of the heart's emotion,
    seeking out that kiss
    which transforms him into nothing...

    Only as nothing can the human heart
    withstand the lover's stare;
    only as empty can it be filled,
    only as void can it know being --
    like the ear which does not speak
    and the mouth which does not hear,
    as long as we proclaim, proclaim, unceasing,
    her words cannot be heard:
    "I am here."
