    Love is a land outside of place and time
    where the moments are sweet eternities
    but those forevers are gone too fast.

    The doorways to that region can be found
    in a pair of eyes, a smile, or those times
    when thoughts and words remain unneeded.

    Those who journey there go hand in hand,
    holding tight as they cross between the worlds;
    for love is a land outside place and time:

    So it matters not the where and when,
    but the heart who helped you believe it.
