#+title: The danger of praise

As for the danger of praise, it is only so venemous as the desire to
escape the consequences of past actions. One is always who he has chosen
to be. Once he can accept the biting pain that comes with admitting a
bad decision, he will openly welcome the wondrous bounty of
acknowledging a good one. Life is but a succession of such choices, and
only one's own moral judgment can guide the way. It has nothing to do
with external comments on how this process may appear to others.
