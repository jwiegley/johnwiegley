If God is all that is good, and a perfect Creator, how could He make something
bad? How can things like sorrow and misery be real, if all was created from
good?

If all is good, perhaps we fail to see it because time and space put blinders
on our perception. We see only a limited part, a sliver of a moving whole --
all of which is good, even if one part seems disjoint from that theme. The
"whole picture" cannot be stopped or divided, and still be seen. It includes
all the movements of reality, so cannot be frozen; it comprises every element,
so cannot be separated without appearing as other than what it is, which is
perfect -- if indeed it was created by a good and perfect Creator.

What limits and divides our perception are ideas. They abstract from the All
certain parts, to allow us to interact with those parts individually. But as
long as our consciousness founds itself in ideas, we fail to perceive what
lies outside them. Like the eye's ability to focus, which must pick out
certain parts from a whole field, in order to "know" things we contrast them
with other "things". Contrast and distinction make up our awareness, but they
also blind us to the All.

There is an exit to this paradox: The knowledge of things through contrast
*itself* contrasts with the nature of the All. Our method of awareness can lead
to an awareness of what lies outside it! Through this leap, we may be able to
see things without knowing them as "things". Our awareness is able to
transcend the requirements of awareness. Thus contrast, which makes
observation of the All impossible, can permit us to become aware of the
All. It is like a hidden doorway into a different world.

For the remainder of this essay, I refer to operations outside the scheme of
ideas as *knowing* and *seeing*, with the idea that *knowing* follows from
realizing the incapacity of knowledge -- and what it is incapable in regards
to -- and *seeing* comes from abandoning the futility of sight for the same
reason.

Since ideas divide reality, it is they that distinguish "good" from
"bad". They make the All appear to contain these two attributes, which appear
when we look at one part in exclusion from the rest. Since the All was created
by a good and perfect Creator, the nature of the All must be only good -- and
perfect good -- so that ideas allow us to see only "somewhat good" and
"somewhat bad" on a sliding scale. In fact, since the underlying reality is
only perfect good, what ideas see are merely differentiated values of good
from lesser to greater extent. There is no "bad" per se: what we call "bad" is
an arbitrary line drawn on the gradient between the least perceived good and
the most perceived good. Then each definition of good and bad relates to the
perceiver, because each draws that line differently.

This gradient exists only for ideas. If we did not see with ideas, not only
would our sight be undifferentiated, but we would *see* only the underlying,
perfect good. Thus if "joy" is what attends our experience of the good, and
sadness of the bad, then once we *see* there can be no more sadness, as "bad"
no longer has meaning. Sorrow was never real -- since the underlying reality
is perfect good -- it was simply the perceived form of our deficiency of
understanding. Once there is *knowledge*, sorrow can no longer be. This
accords with a statement found in the Bahá'í writings:

> This is a station which, wert thou to attain unto it, thou wouldst arrive at
> a happiness which would not be followed by sadness, a joy which is not
> succeeded by grief, an ease and comfort that does not end in distress and
> hardship, a prosperity that does not turn to destitution and misfortune, for
> the might of thy Lord has grasped firmly the reins of affairs.[^1]

And also here:

> The wayfarer in this Valley [of Knowledge] seeth in the fashionings of the
> True One nothing save clear providence, and at every moment saith: "No
> defect canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze:
> Seest thou a single flaw?" He beholdeth justice in injustice, and in
> justice, grace. In ignorance he findeth many a knowledge hidden, and in
> knowledge a myriad wisdoms manifest.[^2]

If *seeing* leads to an experience of life which is only good, perhaps the
purpose of sight through ideas is to lead us to *sight*. In other words, the
nature of the world we first experience, through ignorance, exists in order
for us to become truly aware. Without that first, deficient awareness, we
could not become *aware* of what such awareness cannot approach. The fundamental
paradox of contrast must resolve itself for the circle to close in a conscious
way.

To say it again: The purpose of the world of seeming, with its mixture of
"good" and "bad", "joy" and "sorrow", is to offer a hidden door, on the other
side of which is a true *awareness* of the Good -- an awareness fundamentally
different from what we started with. It's like teaching a baby how to use a
muscle, which can only be learned from the exercise of it. In this way I
understand the tradition:

> "O my Lord, how shall we reach unto Thee?" And the answer came, "Leave
> thyself behind, and then approach Me."[^3]

That is, in order to exit the world of ideas we must learn to leave them
behind, foremost among which is "self".

How to find this door and achieve *sight*? Well, an element exists to religion
which is all about learning to see what doesn't appear to be there, such as
seeing good in the bad that happens to us: Faith. Faith believes that the
reality it fails to see is more real than what it does see. It suggests that
what we think exists perhaps doesn't exist at all. And faith develops, not by
adding to an ever-growing store of ideas, but by weakening their hold on us
through various exercises, such as: detachment, meditation, regarding our
strength as weakness and our wealth as poverty, lessening our love of "self",
etc. All of these aspects of religion aim at making the door to the All
visible. I even think now that all of religion aims at this on the personal
and social scale, that from this goal are born all its laws and
institutions. Only when they depart from this objective, of truly awakening
man to the perfect joy of *knowing* God, do they go astray.

Concerning the world beyond the door, because division cannot comprehend it,
concepts must regard it as a single reality. Although that world exists within
this world -- beyond the veil of ideas -- it cannot be perceived except by
*seeing* it. As Lao Tzu put it, "Looked at, it cannot be seen." A man in this
realm might use concepts, but he no longer sees in terms of them. In order to
*know*, he gives up knowledge. When hungry he might look for food, but he no
longer knows what "hunger" and "food" are. "Thus is it said, `Absolute unity
excludeth all attributes.'"

The world beyond the door is not just a cause for undimmed joy, it is the very
meaning of joy: to know the good. To such a degree that what we call "joy" is
but a shadow of the truth. Everything in this "world" is a shadow cast from
that world, along a gradient from light to dark. The perfect good is reflected
as "good" and "bad", perfect joy is reflected as "joy" and "sorrow", and every
other kind of perfection is seen here as more or less imperfect.

The real world is kept from us, not by the barrier of physical death, but the
death of our "selves" who hold so dearly to the illusory world of
concepts. The true reality, unlimited by time or space, *is* the world. All
failure, impermanence, and insecurity arise from the way we see it, or how our
"first awareness" divides and separates it. What we call "flawed" is in fact
perfect, and what we call "impermanent" is essentially eternal. It only seems
otherwise. And thus, by transcending the limits of our vision, our souls may
enter the heaven intended for them, which has been here with us all along.

> lifted from the face of thy heart and that thou mayest be reckoned among
> them whom God hath graced with such penetrating vision as to behold the most

> attain a station wherein one seeth no distinction amongst His creatures and
> findeth no flaw in the creation of the heavens and the earth.[^4]
