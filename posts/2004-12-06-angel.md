    I knew a girl
    whom it hurt to look upon.
    She was a moving form of pain:
    a pillar of fire.
    Her soft hair made me ache.
    Her walk was a dagger,
    her smile like a brand.
    Every word she spoke
    was heaven's own agony.

    She was so beautiful
    it transcended delight.
    She took beauty, and turned it
    into something unbearable.
    She became, to me,
    a source of mystic knowledge:
    that a vision can be so good
    you almost wish it never was.

    I learned from her
    the way of the moths,
    who long for the light
    that burns them.
    How like a flame she was.
    How divinely consuming.

    I cannot even describe it.
    Instead, I speak of the pain
    and hope you will understand:
    for it was a good thing --
    so good, it became bad:
    bad for the limited me,
    good for my true self.

    A beauty like that
    tears you out
    by your optic nerve,
    and rips away all complacent being.
    What is left cannot be pictured.
    I can only tell what happened
    to what was left behind.
