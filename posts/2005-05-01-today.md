    I find myself happy today
    for one thing above all:
    that I've learned what it means
    to like one's self completely.

    Certainly not because of
    any degree of perfection;
    that, I was never able to achieve.

    But as I look at
    the people around me --
    the variety of characters,
      attitudes, activities --
    I find a certain, indescribable beauty
    pervades them all.

    Life is not about
    what is deserved -- but what is;

    And if we fail to recognize
    this amazing beauty before us,
    so evident -- right here,
    in this company, right now --

    If we neglect to perceive
    what it's trying to show,
    we will have missed out
    on a precious opportunity.
