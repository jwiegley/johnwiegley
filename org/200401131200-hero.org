#+title: "Hero"

Just received a DVD in the mail that I ordered a few days ago: Jet Li's
"Hero". This title has almost becoming my favorite all-time movie. It
should be released in US theaters this April. Or you can order it for
$14, shipping included, from:
[[http://www.wmmb.us/index.cfm/fa/items.main/parentcat/6520/subcatid/14548/id/70834][Jet
Li "Hero" DVD]]. This version of the DVD is all in Chinese, but the
webpage tells how to turn on the English subtitles.

The film is similar in feel to "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon". It is
also a Kung Fu epic, with hauntingly surreal landscapes and action
sequences. Throughout, it focuses on the spirit and depth of its main
characters. It is a film of beauty, with the quality of a dream.
