#+BEGIN_VERSE
Trees are aflame in a fire without heat.
Golden reds and crimson yellows climb through the branches.

A kiss of temperate winds on the cheek.
A feel of soft grasses, and sounds muffled by leaves.

The heat of summer days giving way.
Cool nights of bullfrogs and cricket songs.

The moon, a shade of water's blue.
The starlight neither hazy, nor winter bright.
