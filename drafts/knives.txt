In my kitchen there are lots of different knives: newer, older, sharp and
dull. Knives of all kinds, acquired over years.

When it comes to comparing knives to each other, there are some standards to
distinguish better from worse: sharpness, freedom from rust, straightness,
absence of nicks, etc. In the sense, some of my knives are pretty good, and
same are probably ready to be retired.
