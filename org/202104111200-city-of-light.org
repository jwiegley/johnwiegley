#+BEGIN_VERSE
I have seen a city
of purest light
a brilliant white
the end of night.

I did not see it
with these eyes
nor have I
any description.

It could be
mere fantasy
an errant wish,
a mirage of faith.

How do I know
if it's real?

Look for its reflection
in the shape of hope
a positive mind
an ever-simmering joy.
