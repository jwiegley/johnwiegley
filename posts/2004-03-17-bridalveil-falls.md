    Looking up we saw a face,  
    clear, bold and gazing at the sun.

    Its deep lines bespoke countless years;  
    its running fall of tears, a joyful sadness.

    It was the face of a mountain,  
    Now ten thousand years old,

    Capturing what all faces from the beginning of time have known:  
    Wonder, awe and the patience of long years;

    Surprise, astonishment and the mute wonder we feel  
    When we imagine how all of it came to be.
