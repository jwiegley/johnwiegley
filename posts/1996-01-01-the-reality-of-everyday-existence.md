title: The reality of everyday existence

I am starting to doubt the "reality" of our conscious, everyday,
awareness, since it is so firmly rooted in the falsehood of material
existence.  There is too much that is *more* real, that is not within the
scope of our sensations or awareness.  Perhaps it is faith that allows
us to move in that sphere, and be affected by those influences, more
than it is our limited understanding and sensitivities.  It reminds of
the story of the Roman soldier in the New Testament.  Jesus was healing
people, and the soldier came to him.  Jesus said to lead the way and He
would heal his companion.  But the soldier said, "No.  Only say the word
and I know that he will be healed."  And Jesus marvelled, and told
everyone there that such faith He had not yet encountered.  He then
said, "Be it done according to your faith.  Go home, and you will find
your friend healed."
