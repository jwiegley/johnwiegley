#+BEGIN_VERSE
I remember sun.
I remember evening wind, and
the memory of a pretty girl:
her name was Nicki.
The night was filled with demons
and we lived only for play...
if only my heart could remember.

I felt the anxiousness of long days
as time dallied between summers.
And playing -- such things came naturally.
If only my mind could remember.

What happened from then until now?
The blur is too hard to examine.
I can recall but not account
for so many days of waiting:

Waiting for now, waiting to question,
if all that I'm left
is to remember.
