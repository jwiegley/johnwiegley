    The tree  
    digs its roots deep  
    drawing out  
    nourishment and means  
    from the Earth.

    It stands tall  
    stretching out boughs  
    to receive the Light  
    that shines down  
    from Heaven.

    It yields fruit  
    for others to live by;  
    gives shelter  
    to those below  
    and a home to those above.

    It marries  
    the two Kingdoms  
    of ground and sky  
    into a beautiful  
    bountiful creation.

    If a man  
    could learn  
    such secrets as these  
    he would know  
    his place in the world.
