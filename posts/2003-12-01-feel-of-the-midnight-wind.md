    I know the feel of the midnight wind;
    I know the touch of another's soul.
    Both pass over, moving, changing
    and feeding the fire within.

    At once soft and profound,
    silent and symphonous --
    our wordless exchanges
    touch eye and brow and heart with meaning.

    Yesterday became what it should have been.
    And now, the present forming between us --
    I wonder if that late-night spent
    was not the future as it ought to be.
