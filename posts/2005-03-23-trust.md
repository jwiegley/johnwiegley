    Once, in another world,
    I was sitting with the Shaykh of my spirit,
    a great Master.

    Next to us
    a huge fire was roaring,
    consuming all my books,
    my belongings, even my clothes.

    Then my Master said,
    "Now cast yourself into the flames."
    And so I jumped,
    without a moment's hesitation.

    To my great surprise, I was unburnt.
    The flames were cold to the touch
    although everything around me
    was being destroyed.

    I turned to my Master.
    He was shaking his head.
    "Alas, in the end you have failed me, my pupil."

    "How did I not obey?" I asked.

    He said, "Your failure was this:
    Despite your claims of complete faith in me,
    you expected to be burned."
