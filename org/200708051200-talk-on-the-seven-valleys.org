#+title: Talk on the Seven Valleys

Recently I had the opportunity to give a talk on the Seven Valleys at a
nearby Bahá'í school here in Colorado. The A/V person was able to record
the talk as an MP3, which I offer here to anyone who's interested in the
topic. Please be aware that all opinions are my own. The files are each
around 40 MB in size.
