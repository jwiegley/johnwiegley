#+title: The essence of morality

I believe that morality is this: to see people and the world we live in
as one's highest value. The direct corollary, of course, is that "the
good" begins by valuing one's own life supremely. After all, we take the
best care of what we admire most. Who can truly attend to spiritual
development who has little regard for their own life?

Paradoxically, religion -- its essential mission being the welfare of
mankind -- often interprets its writings in such a way as to violate
this underpinning of morality. By preaching us to disregard the world,
and perceive souls rather than individuals, our moral decisions become
more and more a thing of theory, proceeding from the mind instead of the
heart. And since we then find ourselves living a life contrary to lofty
values, there can be no peace. We are souls at war with the bodies we
find ourselves in. No matter that God created both, we choose to thrown
one away while still in it.

Since the life we live is thus split between actual considerations of a
contemptible world, and potential realities of a world beyond
perception, no wonder we fall into a lackluster approach to morality:
even finding ways to subjugate it altogether to temporal interests (of
course feeling guilt about it, or maybe no guilt at all). This may be
why, although religious scripture underscores patience, kindness and
truthfulness as the most important values in existence, we find
everywhere war, hatred and duplicity in the ranks of the churches. How
to explain it other than that these organizations have inwardly come to
despise their own being? The being we know, after all, must be of a
material nature; and this is exactly what the clergy vociferously
attacks. We are a being divided, with only hate to bridge the gap.

But I believe, looking at the scriptures themselves, that love alone is
the byword of faith. Rather than employing hatred to separate our dual
natures, love is meant to unify them in a harmony. When such a harmony
exists, morality becomes the natural expression of one whose values are
dear to heart. Observe anyone who truly loves his work, and you will see
how much honesty and compassion he pours into it; he can't sleep right
if some flaw mars the overall composition. Then what if we regarded
ourselves this way? As a spiritual work of art? If we loved all of
ourselves -- and others /as/ ourselves, the way a poet admires fine
composition from any hand -- wouldn't this sustain a moral attitude
toward humanity?
