#+BEGIN_VERSE
In the branches
where the wind blows
and daylight fights the shadows
I found you.

Your head tilted back
admiring the clouds
in deep repose of thinking;
I wondered,

What thought-strewn sea
surges up?
What white-clead breakers
bear down
and crash upon that brow?

Such storms within
to counterpoint
the tranquil skies above.
