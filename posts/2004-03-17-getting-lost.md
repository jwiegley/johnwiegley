    We are all butterflies,  
    heading on our way to somewhere wonderful.

    Then one foot gets stuck in the web.  
    And rather than peeling it off  
    and continuing on our way,  
    we feel compelled to look further --  
    when there's nothing further to see!

    So it happens that each step  
    entangles us deeper and deeper.  
    Soon we'll never fly again.

    Then the spider comes  
    and our blood is sucked dry.  
    We are nothing left  
    but a dry carcass, troubled by the wind.
