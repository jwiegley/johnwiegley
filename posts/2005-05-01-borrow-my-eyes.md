    If you could see your own face
    the way I do
    every mirror would trap you.

    Now a nightingale
    you would soon see:
    you are also the rose.

    Your days would be filled up!
    your nights,
    spent in your own arms.

    So why are we divided?
    Why did He give you such beauty
    and me the eyes to see it?

    You look in the mirror and
    think you're not enough...
    but for me
    you are almost too much.

    My toes can't reach the floor
    when you walk by --
    the sky is not high enough
    to describe how I soar!

    Yet you say,
    "I am too fat, too dark,
    too ugly, not good enough."
    and little by little, I die.

    You are stabbing us both
    with that disapproving blade!

    Why can't lover and beloved
    occupy the same space?

    Such beauty --
    it nearly burns my soul! --
    yet fails to admire itself:

    Nicki, Angela, Zhinous,
    Fariba, Nini, Leyla, Samira,
    Mahtab, Nasim, Sandra...

    The list has no end
    of angels who walk this Earth
    but cannot see.

    If only I could loan you
    my eyes
    for one moment!

    If seer and seen
    could put off
    their cloak of separation
    for a while...

    But then,
    if not for that distance,
    what power would move
    this poet's pen?
