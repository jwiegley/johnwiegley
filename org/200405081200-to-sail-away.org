#+title: To sail away

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Globes of moonlight float along the water,
fishes nibble at the morsels of light;
I lean against the railing, hands pressed down,
closing my eyes to remember the sight...

Sail on, lonely barque, carry me far --
Loose my spirit on the darkened seas!
I'll hear no more of heaven and earth:
only waves crashing and the constant breeze.
#+END_VERSE
