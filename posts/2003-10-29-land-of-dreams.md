    Leave me to sleep
    so that I never wake again.

    The sky becomes violet
    the gentle sun wearies
    my eyes weep quietly
    I am home.

    The dark colors of the horizon
    the soft sands of the beach
    the lullaby waves
    welcome me home.

    Take me to the land of dreams
    the shores of the isle Naught
    leaving the world behind
    for everlasting sleep.
