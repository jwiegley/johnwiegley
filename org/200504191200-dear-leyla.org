Dear Leyla,
I wonder if your heart
was really made here.
So pure:
a crystal globe
that catches the sunlight
and sparkles with a
white, colorful fire.

When I talk to you
I swear,
I hear the angels speaking.

How did you come to be?
Were you just there,
one day,
sitting by the road
and your mother took you in?

Dear Leyla,
never change who you are.
Just knowing you
has taught me more
about love.
