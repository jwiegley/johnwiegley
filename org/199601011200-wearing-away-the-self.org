title: Wearing away the self
tags: journal

Our selves can sometimes be like the crust of Earth, which hides the
burning, naked heart. And although sometimes we may erupt, it requires
the patient necessity of time to wear away our exterior. When we look at
the Grand Canyon, we can know that it will happen.

I put my faith in the efficacy of water, and the results which devotion
and labor must achieve. So too the farmer, who spends his life and
effort in the dirt, throwing stony seeds upon the ground, relying on a
hidden process to bring up fruits and flowers from the earth. Every
farmer is a mystic.
