#+title: Reflected back

We dwell in Reality, but do we see it? A great part of what we perceive
seems to be our own self reflected back at us: feeling real enough to
drive our emotions, desires, and fears.

It's like being in an empty room with white walls. We face one of those
walls, except in addition to perceiving what's in front of us, we
project onto it as well: a constant movie of whatever occupies our mind
and hearts. We find this movie so engaging that the wall fully
disappears and we take the movie to be identical with reality.
