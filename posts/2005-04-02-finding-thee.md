Location: La Borgata, Paradise Valley, Arizona

    I turned my sight unto myself  
    and found You  
    standing within me.

    How long I pursued your fragrance --  
    sweet Joseph of my heart! --  
    only to find: I was that bouquet.

    Should a masterpiece ask of itself,  
    "Where is Mastery?  Where is Art?"  
    Behold: they stand within thee!

    Man is the Supreme Talisman.  
    If he hath not known himself  
    how can he know Thee?

    He seeks Music: he is an instrument!  
    He prays for Light: he is a lamp!

    Fruitless, he labors tirelessly,  
    straining every muscle  
    to know the meaning of Effort --  
      and still he does not know...

    Ponder a moment this thought:  
    How can a man know completion  
    if what he seeks is "the Sought"?
