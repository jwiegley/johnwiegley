title: Good bye to all, until we meet again

Now this really is good-bye, because the week is ending, the shops are
closing for their vacation (August is the off-season), everyone is going
on their holidays, and my Internet time is running out.  In all, the
right time to say good-bye, pay for my train ticket, and make my way
back to the United States.

I have only one last realization to offer, in conclusion, which lies
like the capstone on everything before.  It is simple, but took several
experiences to come clear: In essence it is that, just as the soul must
free itself from people and definitions in order to center its life on
Quality, it must also detach itself from its past and future -- since
Quality is found only in the present moment.

With that, this trip has reached its conclusion -- in many ways -- and I
am very much looking forward to returning, and putting all that's been
learned to use.

At the end of this letter are several sentences from the Seven Valleys
(my favorite mystical text, by Bahá'u'lláh).  If you've followed the
essays before now, perhaps you will also see the connections.  It reads
to me as if it had been subtitled, "The Seven Valleys: A Manual for
Finding Quality".

Ciao from Florence.

> 
> ...the denizens of the undying city, who dwell in the green garden

> 
> "...honor us with the love of Thine Essence, that we may be freed from
> turning toward ourselves and toward all else save Thee, and may become

>

> 
> He sitteth on the throne of "Say, all is from God," and taketh his
> rest on the carpet of "There is no power or might but in God."
> 
> He looketh on all things with the eye of oneness, and seeth the
> brilliant rays of the divine sun shining from the dawning-point of
> Essence alike on all created things...
> 
> ...and some have drunk of the wine of oneness and these see nothing
> but the sun itself.
> 
> ...when thou strippest the wrappings of illusion from off thine heart,
> the lights of oneness will be made manifest.
> 
> ...those personages who in a single step have passed over the world of
> the relative and the limited, and dwelt on the fair plane of the
> Absolute, and pitched their tent in the worlds of authority and

> and blotted out these words with a drop of dew.  And they swim in the

> 
> ...shouldst thou taste of [these fruits], thou wilt shield thine eyes

> 
> For on this plane the traveler witnesseth the beauty of the Friend in

> 
> For he hath burnt away the veils with his sighing, and unwrapped the
> shroudings with a single glance; with piercing sight he gazeth on the
> new creation; with lucid heart he graspeth subtle verities.
> 
> At every moment he beholdeth a wondrous world, a new creation, and
> goeth from astonishment to astonishment, and is lost in awe at the
> works of the Lord of Oneness.
> 
> He who hath attained this station is sanctified from all that

> 
> Now hast thou abandoned the drop of life and come to the sea of the
> Life-Bestower.  This is the goal thou didst ask for; if it be God's
