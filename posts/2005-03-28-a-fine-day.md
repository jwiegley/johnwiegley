    The sun is warm today;  
    the breezes are cool.  
    Soft clouds embrace the light  
    and acquire a radiant glow...

    The afternoon passes slowly.  
    Children are playing on the grass.  
    It's been hours since I last wondered  
      what time it was --  
    hours since I thought, instead of lived...

    I wonder: Will You come join me  
    here on the green grasses?  
    Then I recall the sun,  
    the breeze, the clouds, the day...

    When have You ever not been with me?
