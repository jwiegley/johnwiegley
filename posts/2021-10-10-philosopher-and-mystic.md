title: Philosopher and mystic
tags: journal

A philosopher is technically a lover of wisdom, someone who seeks
understanding and a greater comprehension of reality. They revel in shining a
light into dark places, and are characterized by curiosity, profundity, and an
eager desire to improve their character.

A mystic is someone who lives their life according to a greater Reality than
can be immediately or physically perceived; but they do so in the sense of a
drop moving along with the Ocean. Through love and intimate communion they
wish to perceive Reality directly, not only through the lens of the mind or
perception. They seek dissolution and combustion in the flame of love --
moth-like -- rather than the sober gaze of the philosopher.
