#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sometimes,
I'm very quiet --

Like the breeze at midday,
the stillness of a pond
  waiting for the rains,
frogs, patient to begin
  their croaking at night,
the sound of sleepy children,
the twilight dimming,
a thoughtful moon behind grey clouds,
an amber sunset,
the calling of ocean waves,
fond memories of childhood,
a kitten, resting at night,
the whisper of a flame,
the moment of a symphony's last note...
the silence.

If these things can be,
it explains why.
