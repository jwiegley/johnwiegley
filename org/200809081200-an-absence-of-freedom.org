title: An absence of Freedom
tags: journal
---

I live in a part of the world where I can mostly take freedom for
granted. And I think it fair to say that this is how it should be,
everywhere. As I read the speeches of the Romans and the Greeks, I see
how much they loved the idea, and the promise, of freedom. The framework
of America builds on this message of hope, believing that the souls
thrive best when they have room to go. I think even that some American
teenagers wouldn't believe that freedom barely exists in some parts of
the world. It's the twenty-first century after all; wasn't that all a
thing of the past?

But for many, the lack of basic freedoms -- even something as primary as
one's belief in God -- still prevails to this generation. Case in point
are my fellow Bahá'ís in the Middle East and thereabouts. My wife's
family fled persecution to become refugees. Can you believe she couldn't
even pursue a medical school education while living in her own
country? [fn:1]

Sadly, such persecutions are as fresh as the past two weeks. It seems
that the Yemenese government has detained a Bahá'í family for deporation
back to Iran, the very country and government they left in hope of
greater freedoms elsewhere. You can

is this all that remote of an incident, since one of the people being
deported is the father of my aunt's friend.

I'm posting this notice to get the word out there, since many citizens
of these governments simply don't know what's going on. Their media just
doesn't report it. But we who live in the land of freedom can.
