title: Why it seems so hard

I've been thinking about why pursuing a spiritual life can be so
difficult, and I think I can boil it down now to one, core issue:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Our needs are complex, but our desires are basic.

#+END_QUOTE

That is: although our essential needs are very simple -- such as
nearness to God -- by this selfsame token they are complex. Meanwhile,
our desires are exceedingly basic, requiring constant training and
attention to raise them to a higher standard.

** Simple versus complex
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: simple-versus-complex
:END:
Because a system is complex does not make it complicated. A complicated
system defies understanding because it is filled with too many distinct
ideas; a complex system, on the other hand, defies understanding because
of the richness of its core simplicity.

As an example of this, consider the binary number system. It's composed
of exactly two digits, no more, no less: one and zero. It could also be
expressed as true and false, black and white, up and down, right and
wrong, etc., etc. Any world described in opposites is a binary world.

Binary is handy because computer systems are binary, representing their
digits as "high power" and "low power". You could say all a computer is
is a binary machine to manipulate electrical and magnetic fields. That
these binary-based manipulations result in pages being printed, screens
filled with pictures, or sound coming out of a speaker, does not change
the fact that at its core, everything is encoded and decoded in terms of
simple, 0 and 1 values.

Think about that for a moment: Everything you see or hear from a
computer, whether it be Beethoven's 9th symphony, watching Find Nemo, or
writing e-mail to a friend in Des Moines: all you see and hear can be
represented as a combination of ones and zeroes. If it were any more
complicated than this, a computer would be incapable of processing it.
Yet this is also what makes it so /complex/: that even knowing a DVD is
made up of ones and zeroes cannot help you understand how it works.

** Basic versus advanced
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: basic-versus-advanced
:END:
While our needs as spiritual beings may be ultimately simple, what
messes us up is that our desires are at the same time exceedingly basic.

What I mean by basic is this: A person stranded on an ocean without
water will sometimes, if they get thirsty enough, drink seawater in an
effort to make their thirst go away. Their knowledge that it won't help
the situation is overridden by the nature of desire itself. The mind
knows, "I need water", but the body says only, "I want to drink".

A basic desire is heedless of the quality of its choice, or the
consequences to the individual. Hunger says, "eat". It doesn't know
about eating healthily or wisely. And the stronger a desire gets over
time, the less it confers with the rest of one's being in seeking its
satisfaction.

What this means is that, from the very beginning of life, we must train
our desires to be more profitable. Children may try to eat anything, but
maturity makes us more and more discriminating. Teenagers might even
choose to diet, preferring health or beauty over the demands of their
stomach. Then comes eating the right things, avoiding harmful or useless
foods, etc., etc. By the time a person is older they must be very
conscious of what they put in their mouths, or else their health (and
perhaps even life) will suffer the consequences.

The same is true with desire in general. Although desire is valuable for
/pushing/ us toward our goals, we must make informed choices. How often
desire chooses an unworthy target, with a compulsion very real and
powerful. But we must master those desires, so that, like a bloodhound,
they can be turned away from lesser prey and focused again on our truest
need.

** Aye, there's the rub

This is where it seems we have a difficult road ahead of us: our needs
are elegantly complex, a bar of notes arranged into a symphony; while
our desires are crude and basic, more like a toddler banging on a drum.
This turns us into creatures of confusion. We know we need something,
but we can't identify it despite sincere effort; meanwhile our desires
scream for whatever is nearest at hand or in our thoughts.

What chance have we, then, if what we need is beyond our understanding,
but what we want is destructive to that very need? How much easier to
crown our desires with truth so we can pursue them whole-heartedly and
freely, than to rule our burning fires in the name of an Unseen!

I think it is in answer to this very state that Scripture was given to
us. It offers enough of guidance to entince us along the Right Path, but
little enough substance so we don't mistake it for the Goal itself. It
says to me, "That you want is right and true, but for what you want:
there is Better." That these binary-based manipulations result in pages
being printed, screens filled with pictures, or sound coming out of a
speaker, does not change the fact that at its core, everything is
encoded and decoded in terms of simple, 0 and 1 values.
