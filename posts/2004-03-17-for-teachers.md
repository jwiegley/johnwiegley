    "In a drop thou beholdest the secrets of the sea"  
    so with all the perfections potential in thee.

    As a teacher draws forth from the days of youth  
    our thoughts and ideas on the subject of truth,

    the mind develops, and the hearts unfold --  
    bearing diamonds and rubies, emeralds and gold --

    from that inner land, hidden in the eyes of a babe,  
    every great man and woman is made.
