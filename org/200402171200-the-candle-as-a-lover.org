#+title: The candle as a lover

Today a poem, using the well-known metaphor of [[file:the.candle][The
Candle]] to depict the heights of mystic love -- in which the lover
becomes as nothing in devotion to his friend. Or as Bahá'u'lláh words it
in /The Seven Valleys/:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
For when the true lover and devoted friend reacheth to the presence of
the Beloved, the sparkling beauty of the Loved One and the fire of the
lover's heart will kindle a blaze and burn away all veils and wrappings.
Yea, all he hath, from heart to skin, will be set aflame, so that
nothing will remain save the Friend.
