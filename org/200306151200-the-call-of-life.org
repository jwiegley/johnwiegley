#+title: The call of life

#+BEGIN_VERSE
We live to live
have choice to choose
freedom to err and succeed
time to grow, to act
death to humble us
and life to shine with glory.
We need no one but ourselves
to be who we are.

It takes many hands to raise a building
but only if each does its own work
and does it well.
