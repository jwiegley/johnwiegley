#+title: Thought and ignorance

Thought is based in ignorance, since the motive for engaging in thought
is to effect a transition into knowledge. But if thought is based in
knowledge, where is the motive? It heads nowhere, because it's already
arrived; and so the mind stays relatively quiet, and uncreative. To
think productively, we must find a point of ignorance, and allow it to
suffuse our whole mind. Then, as if becoming a child or a student, we
may now be taught according to what we see at first as foolishness, and
perhaps later as understanding.
