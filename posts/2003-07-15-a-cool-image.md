    The vapors rising off the ice:
    a sublime landscape of winter:
    arctic pieces of the sea trapped
    in the white amber of millennia.

    The seals below bump their heads,
    the bears in white coats rumble their hunger;
    against the black night, the white fox howls
    and the rabbit hears him in the echoes of sleep.
