    lazily drifting on the breeze
    scents of summer, jasmine and orange
    the sun tinging all with gold
    beneath skies of spotted blue
    the music of leaves, of crickets
    of midnight frogs in the trees
    soft grass between my toes
    the cool touch of the lake
    and ringing tones of laughter...

    whatever season it may be
    summer is in the heart.
