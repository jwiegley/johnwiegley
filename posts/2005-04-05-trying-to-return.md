    I was a fish
    of the vasty deep.
    Alone on beds
    of coral and pearl
    I used to take my sleep.

    Until one day
    I climbed up high
    and filled my lungs with air --
    now I cannot dive at all
    except into despair.

    I prayed to God,
    "Assist my way!
    I long to know Your depths --
    if only for this bulb of air
    this cursèd gasp of breath."

    How can nothing
    keep me from Something?
    This air inside me
      is not me
    but binds me just as well.

    So God answered
    and poked me good
    to save me from my hell.
