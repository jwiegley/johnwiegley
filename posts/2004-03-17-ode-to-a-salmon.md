    Flesh: pink, cold, oily:  
    Covering rice: wet, shining and white;

    My tongue embraces what soon disappears,  
    as a lover who comes and leaves in the night.

    Like a truth known only in doing:  
    a temporary, unexplainable right;

    That fish I had still plays with me,  
    and lingers on in memory's sight.

    Just a fish, you ask?  Don't play the fool;  
    only a master, striving could cut it just quite.

    Ah, what my mouth wouldn't give to taste it again...  
    another round of that ultimate bite.
