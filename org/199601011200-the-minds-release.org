title: The mind's release

When, through meditation, the mind has a release from the conscious
duality of opposites, there is a dawning within the person that occurs.
The direct effect of this is that it bestows upon life a certain
vitality; it's almost a meaning bestowing force. It's like opening the
inner eye, a door that leads to the inner reality of things. Because the
mystical/mythical component of man begins to direct itself toward the
eternal aspects of things. As Bahá'u'lláh says, "A pure heart is as a
mirror, cleanse it with the burnish of all things save God, that the
true Sun may shine within it..."
