#+title: Images from the Southwest

Starting from south of Phoenix, this month I went to Albuquerque, then
the Navajo reservation, then Flagstaff, back to Albuquerque, then to
Sante Fe, and at last up here to Colorado Springs. Although I took more
than 500 pictures, only a few of them turned out to my taste. Those
pictures can be seen [[file:gallery/New%20Mexico/index.html][here]]. The
girl who appears in two of them is my friend Marjan, who took me up to
the top of Sandia Peak outside Albuquerque.
