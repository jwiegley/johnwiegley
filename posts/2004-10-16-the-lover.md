    A lover hasn't the heart for knowledge
    nor the patience for study.
    He already knows to perfection
    when the Beloved is near.

    Does a thirsty man sit and
    debate the words for water?
    Give him one glass, and he will
    drink the truth of them all.

    Such a one does not notice pain.
    In him, all things are consumed.
    He glows with inner heat;
    his eyes are embers from the fire.

    Yet because of that negation
    he feels Her touch like no other;
    because he burns with unending thirst
    a drop tells the mystery of oceans.

    Thus, the lover takes to pain
    like a student to a favored lesson:
    for insofar as he writhes in agony
    Her merest word of balm is revelation.
