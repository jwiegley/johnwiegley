    Dear reader!

    You are the unsought treasure.
    The jewel mistaken for glass.
    The sleeping queen taken for a peasant.

    Awaken your true self!
    You are the gateway, the hidden door,
    the catalyst for what might be.

    A painting in a lightless cave
      is equal to the pressing void.
    You were made to catch the light;
    to reveal its beauty secrets.

    Your nature is never far from Him.
    Only: the unlit candle
      knows nothing at first
    of Heat and Flame.
