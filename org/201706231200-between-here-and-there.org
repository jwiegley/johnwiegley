#+title: Between here and there

When we start from the assumption that between "here" and "There" a
great distance remains, the Divine is very hard to find because it
dwells closer than our life's vein.

The body, and the needs of body, are not a standard for the spirit.
Thus, interpreting "good" as pleasant, and "evil" as pain or loss, makes
reading religious scripture very confusing indeed.

The motion of the sun seems so obvious from our earth-bound perspective:
turning and twirling, ever-dancing. Now rise above the perception of
human conception, and see that you are the dancer: all these changes and
chances are within you. The Sun has been One all along.
