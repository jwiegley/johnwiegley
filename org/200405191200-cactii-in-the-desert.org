#+title: Cactii in the Desert

These past two weeks I have been traveling between California and
Arizona (a full day of driving so far). I'll be back in San Francisco
area next week -- at which point I hope to get more quality time for
writing. But until then, [[file:gallery/Arizona/Tucson/index.html][a few
photos of the desert]].
