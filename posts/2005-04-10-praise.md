    What expressions of love  
      He deserves from me!  
    What better actions  
      than those I perform!  
    What kinder words  
      than what I've written!  
    What higher thoughts  
      than my highest attempt!

    My faith is bound  
    by the limits of my being.  
    Were it bound by the limits of His,  
    how could I remain?

    Like a flickering flame  
    before the Almighty Sun:  
    I would suddenly disappear.
