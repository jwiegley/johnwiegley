    The moth is a mystic prince:
    one who seeks the light
    because he can live no other way.

    The moon beckons him
    across vast, impossible distances --
    yet on he flies
    never thinking of his headway.

    If he reach a fire
    and have nothing for the altar,
    he places himself upon the stone
    and becomes what he admires.

    Only the moth knows
    that love is not enough.
    His search will never cease until he blazes
    with the same light that he seeks.
