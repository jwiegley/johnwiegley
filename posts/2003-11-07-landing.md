    Landing after so long a flight
    turning on the hot water
    washing the stains of travel...

    The bed welcomes like a lover,
    the clean sheets embrace me,
    the pillow's constant touch is a kiss.

    I left another continent tonight,
    adding its fair memories
    to the book of my heart's history.
