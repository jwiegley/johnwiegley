title: The truth of the present

The only truth we encounter is the present, and the words of the
prophets. Because the past we remember inaccurately, and our conceptions
of the future are uncertain. And all of our abstractions about reality
are incomplete. Although we may not understand the truth that is
presented, that is the form in which it presents itself to us.
