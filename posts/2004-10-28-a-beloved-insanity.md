    Love is a beloved insanity.
    If tongues could speak the tale
    of love's madness,
    no hearers would remain.

    They would, as one breath,
    ascend ash-like upon the breeze
    offering their hearts to the pyre --
    and not a one complain.

    For when it touched my own lips,
    it ruined my heart's kingdom.
    Peace became a travesty:
    my very hope was my despair.

    Where banners once flew in proud disdain
    a king now weeps for his kingdom's bane.
