    My life was a fertile ground
    but bare.
    So I prayed for what was needed --
    the fruits and the flowers --
    and every prayer I made
    planted a seed.

    What I could not know
    is how each plant must grow:
    some put out thorns
    before blossoms;
    some are only gnarled wood
    until the first fruit appears.

    Now I look around
    at the crazy jungle of my life
    thinking each leaf,
    each thorny branch,
    is a part of something more.
