#+BEGIN_VERSE
I meant to send you a rose today;
but the distance was too great.

But not for words.

And I began to wonder:
  how many letters before I match
  the softness of a petal's touch?
  How many thoughts, mulled together,
  can conjure up the image
  of lilies, waving in the spring?

I know your heart is fertile,
and its soil ready for the seed...
Would not a single, quiet glance,
suffice to set the rendezvous?

Then here it is:
  be mine.
I think the silence says the rest.
