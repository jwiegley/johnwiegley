    Your beauty is a thief  
    that steals the breath from my lungs;  
    a tryant who commands the motion of my eyes;  
    like a fire loosed in a dry wood,  
    or salt rubbed into a soldier's wound:  
    your form is both the torment and the prize.

    How can I call it good  
    when all pain and heartache  
    are its proof and sign?  
    Yet somehow,  
    that fire and salt have a sugar's taste;  
    that thirst and burning, a savor like scented wine.

    Love is indeed the true insanity!  
    When all else is reduced to shambles,  
    and the lover's heart, a place of ruin,  
    he begs only for more of the same:  
    a last glance, a parting word,  
    the chance meeting of a pair of eyes...

    Ruin me!  End me!  Destroy this fool some more!  
    The mention of your beauty alone undoes me;  
    and that undoing binds me again,  
    and chains this Sisyphus to his poetic demise.
