title: Passage from Watts

Continuing on with my reading of Alan Watts, I came across these
paragraphs, which express so well much of what I've been meaning to say:

> In the strictest sense, we cannot actually think about life and
> reality at all, because this would have to include thinking about
> thinking, thinking about thinking about thinking, and so *ad infinitum*.
> One can only attempt a rational, descriptive philosophy of the
> universe on the assumption that one is totally separate from it.  But
> if you and your thoughts are part of this universe, you cannot stand
> outside them to describe them.  This is why all philosophical and
> theological systems must ultimately fall apart.  To "know" reality you
> cannot stand outside it and define it; you must enter int it, be it,
> and feel it.
>
> Speculative philosophy, as we know it in the West, is almost entirely
> a symptom of the divided mind, of man trying to stand outside himself
> and his experience in order to verbalize and define it.  It is a
> vicious circle, like everything else which the divided mind attempts.
>
> On the other hand, the realization that the mind is actually undivided
> must have a corresponding and equally far-reaching influence on
> thought and action.  As the philosopher tries to stand outside himself
> and his thought, so, as we have seen, the ordinary man tries to stand
> outside himself and his emotions and sensations, his feelings and
> desires.  The result is a fantastic confusion and misdirection of
> conduct which discovery of the mind's unity must bring to an end.
>
> So long as the mind is split, life is perpetual conflict, tension,
> frustration, and disillusion.  Suffering is piled on suffering, fear
> on fear, and boredom on boredom.  The more the fly struggles to get
> out of the honey, the faster he is stuck.  Under the pressure of so
> much strain and futility, it is no wonder at all that men seek release
> in violence and sensationalism, and in the reckless exploitation of
> their bodies, their appetites, their material world, and their fellow
> men.  What this must add to the necessary and unavoidable pains of
> existence is incalculable.
>
> But the undivided mind is free from this tension of trying always to
> stand outside oneself and to be anywhere than here and now.  Each
> moment is lived completely, and there is thus a sense of fulfillment
> and completeness.  The divided mind comes to the dinner table and
> pecks at one dish after another, rushing on without digesting anything
> to find out better than the last.  It finds nothing good, because
> there is nothing which it really tastes.
>
> When, on the other hand, you realize that you live in, indeed *are* this
> moment now, and no other, that apart from this there is no past and no
> future, you must relax and taste to the full, whether it be pleasure
> or pain.  At once it becomes obvious why this universe exists, why
> conscious beings have been produced, why sensitive organs, why space,
> time, and change.  The whole problem of justifying nature, of trying
> to make life mean something in terms of its future, disappears
> utterly.  Obviously, it all exists for this moment.  It is a dance,
> and when you are dancing you are not intent on getting somewhere.  You
> go round and round, but not under the illusion that you are pursuing
> something, or fleeing from the jaws of hell....
>
> The meaning and purpose of dancing is the dance.  Like music, also, it
> is fulfilled in each moment of the course.  You do not play a sonata
> *in order* to reach the final chord, and if the meaning of things were
> simply in ends, composers would write nothing but finales....
>
> When each moment becomes an expectation life is deprived of
> fulfillment, and death is dreaded for it seems that here expectation
> must come to an end.  While there is life there is hope -- and if one
> lives on hope, death is indeed the end.  But to the undivided mind,
> death is another moment, complete like every moment, and cannot yield
> its secret unless lived to the full --
>
>
> > *And I laid me down with a will.*
>
> Death is the epitome of the truth that in each moment we are thrust
> into the unknown.  Here all clinging to security is compelled to
> cease, and wherever the past is dropped away and safety abandoned,
> life is renewed.  Death is the unknown in which all of us lived before
> birth.
>
> Nothing is more creative than death, since it is the whole secret of
> life.  It means that the past must be abandoned, that the unknown
> cannot be avoided, that "I" cannot continue, and that nothing can be
> ultimately fixed.  When a man knows this, he lives for the first time
> in his life.  By holding his breath, he loses it.  By letting it go he
> finds it.
