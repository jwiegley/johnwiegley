#+title: As a glass

#+BEGIN_VERSE
When before I'd wandered
along the sea of the Unseen
I'd make of myself a glass
to catch every drop I was able...

Though after time'd passed
I'd look at what I'd found
And see: few attributes of
the sea had endured:

No color; no depth or richness...
Instead, I saw those parts
that fit within me:
wetness, fluidity,
salt upon the tongue...

No one had told me
that my true nature
is more fish-like than man.
All I need do is accord
with my inmost desire
and leave behind all
that I claim as my own.

Then, from this place
of quiet and abiding peace,
I send you greetings
and ask not to return.
