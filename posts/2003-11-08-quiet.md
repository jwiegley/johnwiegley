    Sometimes,  
    I'm very quiet --

    Like the breeze at midday,  
    the stillness of a pond  
      waiting for the rains,  
    frogs, patient to begin  
      their croaking at night,  
    the sound of sleepy children,  
    the twilight dimming,  
    a thoughtful moon behind grey clouds,  
    an amber sunset,  
    the calling of ocean waves,  
    fond memories of childhood,  
    a kitten, resting at night,  
    the whisper of a flame,  
    the moment of a symphony's last note...  
    the silence.

    If these things can be,  
    it explains why.
