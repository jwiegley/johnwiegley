There are two different kinds of recognition: surface recognition, or acknowledgement; and true recognition, where one understands the fullness of a thing and its implications -- not merely its shape or name.

For example, if the President of the United States were to enter a kindergarten class, I'm sure most of the students would "recognize" him.  They could give his name, title, and where they'd seen him last.  But if the same President entered a classroom of graduate students in political science, the difference in degree of ther recognition is due to years of study and experience in the field he represents.

Similarly, when the Bahá´í Writings speak of recognizing the Manifestation of God, I think it is much more than acknowledging His name, or naming His station.  True recognition is something that can only occur after having been immersed in the Truth He represents.
