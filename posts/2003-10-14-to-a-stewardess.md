    Not wizards
    can best the enchantment
    of a pretty girl.
    Her long, smooth legs are divine;
    the flow of her hair is magic;
    her waves of blonde
    are more welcome to me
    than sunrise.

    Something about the tightness of her body
    constricts me also --
    holds my heart in an unseen hand --
    the way witches of old were famed for.

    Maybe all this talk of warlocks and wonder
    are but metaphors for a woman's charm;

    For indeed, I can say,
    in just the meeting of your eyes,
    was all the power and effect
    that spells are known for.
