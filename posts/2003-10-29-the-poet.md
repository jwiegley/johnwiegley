    A poet never knows which way
      his pen will go, his mind will go;
    the canvas of the soul
    heeds his worded strokes --
    but the image remains unseen.

    Just as we speak from feeling,
    making full sentences
      not knowing them beforehand,

    there is a vastness, unfilled,
    begging for that single drop...
    whose echoes
    are the shape of my words on paper.
