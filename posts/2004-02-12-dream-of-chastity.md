    For you, my dear, the best alone  
    is good enough:  
    only the purest, only the true:

    So each kiss I steal from your lips --  
    like Robin's gifts --  
    I add to your spirit's few.

    The worldly hold you  
    in such regard,  
    you're wealthy from all their praise;

    But to touch you not is  
    to touch your soul  
    in still far lovelier ways...

    How many are those who would  
    stay their hand  
    to hold what cannot be reached?

    Or speak with their silence --  
    their honor's voice --  
    whose call even angels beseech?

    I know the distance  
    can seem so far,  
    those times when bodies are near;

    But the truth is mystical,  
    magic and fey:  
    that souls make love when they fear.
