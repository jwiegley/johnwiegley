#+title: Grandfather clock

#+BEGIN_VERSE
She's only six, and the tension is terrible;
If only this hour would be on its way!
Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
Parcels out time in infinitesimal moments
Until for her, eternity has finally passed away.

He is sixteen, with eyes in the clouds,
While his teacher drags him back to class.
Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
Counts a second for a second;
Until sixty times sixty
Rewards his patience at last.

The man and woman with "Baby on Board"
Are a few minutes late -- and not one to spare!
Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
Steals an hour from their lives,
And leaves them rapt in despair.

A gentleman with a watch
Watches the watch watch him.
Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
Is a year off his life
And what's left grows dim.

Grandfather at last! for whom the clock was built.
It's not too late for that old gray head.
Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
Is a lifetime -- a journey:
For with each tick he's reborn.
And with each tock, struck dead.
