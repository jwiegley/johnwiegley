title: The Divine Unity

I believe that the worlds of limitation and differentiation, and the world
of Unity, are things we already fully understand.  Maybe not in spiritual
terms, but indeed viscerally, in physical terms.

Consider my own body.  It represents the world of differentiation in that it
has many parts, each with its own aspect and purpose.  My hands and feet
couldn't be more different, are located separately, and have no direct
communication.  The loss of one is nothing like the loss of the other.
Their sense of touch is not equally sensitive, nor is their manner of use
similar.

Yet the variety and plurality of my body in no way inhibits the perception
of each part as integral to an indivisible whole.  When I examine any aspect
of my body, 'I contemplate nothing whatsoever but that I see myself
therein'.  Even if it's just a useless flap of skin near my least
significant toe, I still consider those cells "me", without contemplating
that my brain cells are more valuable or useful.  Self-perception is
immediate and unbiased.  It takes an effort of will to see myself as "many",
since my instinctive, gut reaction is to regard myself as one.

Put another way, I would say that the unity of my being cannot be explained
as the ubiquity of my selfhood appearing within my body parts.  It is much
more fundamental than that; fundamental enough that it feels odd to question
the unity of my being, or the multiplicity of my body, as if they were
separate realities.  My spirit is one, and does not suffer if you remove a
hand or a leg; the manyness of my form does not impact the singleness of my
reality.  And yet the nature of my form, no matter how it appears or changes
through time, is at all times an expression of the potentialities of my
spirit.  This oneness and manyness are bound together to such a degree that
they represent a greater unity in which this singleness is not different
from its manyness: "In this Valley, the wayfarer leaveth behind him the
stages of the 'oneness of Being and Manifestation' and reacheth a oneness
that is sanctified above these two stations."

To translate this from the physical realm to the spiritual: The oneness of
my body is plain to me because of the singularity of my consciousness.  I do
not ascribe a similar unity to inanimate things, where I'm persistently
aware of their separation into parts.  Only when it comes to people and
animals -- only when there is an animating spirit -- do I resist dividing
the subject.  I don't pet the hairs on a cat's back, I pet the cat; I don't
talk to a friend's ears, I talk to my friend.  But when I use my computer,
I'm always typing at a keyboard and looking at a monitor.  A computer is
just a group of parts working together; I perceive no transcendent unity.

This same bias applies to God's creation.  When seen as inanimate, it is
just an amalgam of innumerable, separate-yet-related things; but even as my
spirit animates my body, using it as the seat of its manifestation, so too
God's Spirit animates the world, and all the souls within it.

Beholding the Divine Unity, then, is to perceive God's creation in a similar
manner to how we see ourselves: absolutely single in its relationship to His
Essence.  In my own case, there is a hand here and a foot there, but there
are not two beings.  Or there is Jesus and Muhammad, but in truth only one
Ancient Being.  This world and the next, all of Creation, at root expresses
a Oneness which does not admit of differences.  On an outward level one can
say that this or that thing has a special rank or station; but at the level
of true meaning, it is impossible to draw any distinction between them.

From *Gems of the Divine Mysteries*:
