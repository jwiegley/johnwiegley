#+BEGIN_VERSE
Does the wind also
whisper to you
its word of welcome?
Or do you only hear
the rustling of leaves...
Leave behind the world you see
and enter the one now standing
just before your eyes.
I say: it is not a tree,
not bark and branch and bough,
but let my heart name it
and I call it majesty.

Every day of your life
the noble mysteries have been
your confidant.
They have heard every sigh
watched every joy and sorrow
come and go.
So peek out, before the chance
escapes you.
See what wonder hides
even upon this page.
For age will someday
make honest men of all
and some rise to glory's heights
and some to mourning fall.
