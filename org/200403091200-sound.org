#+BEGIN_VERSE
The blue thumbprints of an artist's proof,
labelled on white spheres of alabaster
deep set into a skull of ash
baked in a stone oven.

Befriend the troubled -- his last ray of hope
as a blooded sun casts shadows
on the pitiless hearts of those
who would call him nothing.

Terrified, lonely, consorting with demons
that abide ever between heart and mind,
all waiting to lead unwary souls to
the yawning gates of perdition.
