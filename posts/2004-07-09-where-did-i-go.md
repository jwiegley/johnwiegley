title: Where did "I" go?

Because concepts can never embrace reality, I find myself faced with the
strange mystery that I will never know who or what I am.  "I" is a
place-holder of utility, like a doctor distinguishing liver from kidney.
What "I" refers to, however.... I can't say where it begins or ends.
Why should a border of flesh contain it?  If I don't divide between the
cells of my body, then why individuals?  It would seem scale and purpose
alone determine the differentiation of elements: As I move inward, "me"
fragments into the countless parts of body and mind; as I move outward,
it diffuses until the whole planet is only a speck among billions.
Where on the ladder of scale does "I" rest?  When I don't need to
separate "you" from "me", what meaning does it have?

If none, it is a temporary convenience only, a phantom within the
echelons of description, a humble ghost haunting the spaces between
"large" and "small".  As a word, it assumes everything while telling
nothing -- a formless void kept whole through lack of examination.  For
whenever I look closer, to find the true face who bears my name, I'm at
loss even how to begin.
