#+BEGIN_VERSE
The sun is warm today;
the breezes are cool.
Soft clouds embrace the light
and acquire a radiant glow...

The afternoon passes slowly.
Children are playing on the grass.
It's been hours since I last wondered
  what time it was --
hours since I thought, instead of lived...

I wonder: Will You come join me
here on the green grasses?
Then I recall the sun,
the breeze, the clouds, the day...

When have You ever not been with me?
