#+title: Letter to the Watchman

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Your love is so very hard, my friend --
and so very dear.

Icicles that rain on my heart
offer a cool draught
once the sun of knowing rises;

Bitter grains of salt
make finely piquant
the dishes life sends after;

Harsh fire -- a great inferno --
transfigures my iron soul
into radiant shafts of light...

So very hard, my friend,
yet so dear.
