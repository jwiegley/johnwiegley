    Is the sound of sorrow
    limited, like a voice's cry?

    Or does the soul's suspiration
    heed no boundaries of space or time?

    The winds of late have seemed
    to hold a deeper tone;

    More than just the capping of waves
    along the rolling blue.

    Was that your soft weeping I heard?
    or were those salty drops the ocean's own...
