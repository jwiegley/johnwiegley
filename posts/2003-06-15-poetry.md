    Poetry is what a man writes  
    when he is thrilled  
    by the beauty of his own thought.  
    Some in music, others in diagrams  
    or programs, drawings, schematics...

    In whatever form  
    it is a worship of the glory of knowing  
    and of feeling  
    and of reaching upward  
    to capture a ray from heaven's beauty.

    Then it can be seen  
    that God's greatest gift to man  
    is his intellect.  
    And man's greatest gift to God --  
    and to himself --  
    is to use it.
