#+BEGIN_VERSE
At dawn she reclined in thought,
considering the tapestries of Earth,
finding meaning in the destinies of earth-worms.

Then morning came.

With plant-slowness, her arms unfolded,
and she lifted her leaves to the sun.

What in the night
had been a goddess of melancholy,
reveals colors now
sadness has never known.
