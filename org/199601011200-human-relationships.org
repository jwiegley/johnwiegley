Our relationship with our spouse can be our closest relationship to God.
Proof:

1. Everything in existence is a reflection of God's attributes.

2. Man, above all, is endowed with the capacity to reflect all of God's
   attributes.

3. Our contact with our spouse is the closest contact we will ever have
   with another human being, on all levels.

4. God, in His Essence, is unknowable. We can only relate to Him through
   His attributes.

5. The greater our relationship to those attributes, the greater our
   relationship to God.

6. Since man, above all, reflects His attributes more truly than
   anything else, then through man, the greatest relationship with His
   attributes is possible.

7. Therefore, if our spouse represents our closest human contact, they
   are also potentially our greatest experience of God.
