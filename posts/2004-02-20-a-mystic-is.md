    A mystic, perhaps, is no more than a linguist.  
    He hears the sun's soliloquy in a language of light,  
    and the cloud's quiet mourning whenever it weeps;  
    the sea tells her stories in murmurs and roars,  
    and the sky regales with the secrets she keeps...

    He gives up his ears, the better to hear  
    his hands speak of love as he caresses her cheeks.  
    For when he rests his head on the loved one's chest,  
    her soft breathing, heart beating, gentlest sighs  
    are one with the mysteries of the fathomless deeps.
