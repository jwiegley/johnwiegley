#+title: Desert sands

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Adrift... so terribly adrift.
Ever blown and reconfigured:
never the same.

As white as the pallor of death;
dry, unfeeling,
moving about with a purpose all their own.

So much activity,
so little result.
Moving here and there, only to move back;
today a valley, tomorrow a dune.

Their vastness draws out from me all that I have
and replaces nothing.
Not even the sign that my efforts are worthwhile.

And now they bury me,
these desert sands,
since I have become just as lifeless as they.
