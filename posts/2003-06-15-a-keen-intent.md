    The movements of a train
    over long rails
    of hardened purpose
    a pair of arrows
    forever flying sure
    the cold steel
    impervious to distraction.

    The movements of a train
    upon the iron rails
    without which
    the purpose of even
    the finest engine
    would remain unknown:
    a being without
    the will to move.
