title: Strike while the iron is hot

There's a saying, "Strike while the iron is hot!" When forging iron or
steel, it is very hard and resists change until a certain temperature,
when it suddenly becomes soft like putty. This is when you can decide
the shape and purpose of the blade. Afterward, its attributes are fixed
and resist any change.

As a furnace does this to the metal, this worldly life is similar: hot
and difficult and often damaging, but it makes us soft and pliable, in a
spiritual sense, giving us the freedom to choose our soul's path.

And as the metal is pounded into shape, it is constantly tested: a
repeated cycle of hammering and testing. After the blade is quenched and
ready, no more testing occurs: then is the time for use. `Abdu'l-Bah√°
said, "the tests and trials of God take place in this world, not in the
world of the Kingdom". This is where God discerns our capacities and
what we can bear, but once the metal has set, the time for tests comes
to end.
