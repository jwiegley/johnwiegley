#+title: The Kingdom of God

One of the things religion aims to teach people is how to appreciate
God's creation. In the Seven Valleys, Bahá'u'lláh says the purpose is
"...that every man may thereby win his way to the summit of realities,
until none shall contemplate anything whatsoever but that he shall see
God therein."

Since God is the best of all things: the most beautiful, most wondrous,
most inspiring Reality one could imagine, then seeing him everywhere
means becoming excited by life like a little child. Everything has some
new meaning, some secret to be unwrapped.

This is the Kingdom of God. It is paradise, heaven, the apex of
consciousness and understanding. And He created it for us, His children.
He sent all His Messengers with their Glad-Tidings to summon us to that
pure and perfect world.

Nor is it someplace near or far. It is all around us, within us. If we
see God in people, we can love everyone; if we see Him in the things of
the world, we will fall in love with life; if we see Him in ourselves --
"behold Me standing within thee, Mighty, Powerful and Self-Subsisting"
-- we realize we are never, ever alone.

Christ said, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good
pleasure to give you the Kingdom." This is the life we were created to
know. It is what our souls have longed for since the moment of
conception. And the Path to that Reality can be found through the way of
the Manifestations of God, in Their Writings and Their example.

O My servants! My holy, My divinely ordained Revelation may be likened
unto an ocean in whose depths are concealed innumerable pearls of great
price, of surpassing luster. It is the duty of every seeker to bestir
himself and strive to attain the shores of this ocean, so that he may,
in proportion to the eagerness of his search and the efforts he hath
exerted, partake of such benefits as have been pre-ordained in God's
irrevocable and hidden Tablets.
