title: A constant challenge

It's a constant challenge to me, to appreciate the merits of this world
in its role of hollowing us out and refining us, sharpening our vision
and purifying our heart, to such a degree that when the Divine finally
appears before us, we respond with the love of our entire being.
Darkness makes the eye keener.
