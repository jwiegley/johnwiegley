Ahhhhh... If you can read that as a joy of exhalation like the lungs
clapping, the ribs sequeezing as they hug the air, the heart unable to
keep still while there is still life remaining! At the same tim ethere
both the pain and the joy; the pain of failing (and falling), of doing
the wrong thing at times and having no one to turn to, no one to
exonerate me but myself;
