    O Nasim!
    gentle breeze of the Merciful
    delight to eye and mind
    beauteous form of intellect
    a sharp arrow
    flying through the fields of hearts...
    You've trapped me.
    I think of you often now.
    When will I feel your breezes again
    to lift this building heat
    O Nasim?
