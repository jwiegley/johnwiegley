Wisdom cannot be found without seeking knowledge, but knowledge does not
grant wisdom -- in fact, can prevent it. One must acquire knowledge with
the understanding that only freedom from it will make it worthwhile.

This is the paradox that causes us to fail from the first step. To
answer it requires passing beyond failure and success. It's about the
freedom to see, not the perfection of sight.
