| I awoke to find myself holding a book.
| I did not know its language;
| I could only look at the pictures,
| imagining stories, the way children do.
|
| I began to study, to make an effort
|   to crack the code.
| After which I noticed: the story had a Plot...
|
| Now I read as one who cannot take time for sleep!
|
| That book was my life, my world;
| my understanding: what Your words finally taught me.
