#+title: Outside my window at work

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I was awed by life.

And here I sit,
silent,
lost in that awe.

A tree with its leaves shining;
the sky, a gradient blue;
pure white clouds fading in the sun:
a moment to appreciate.

It may only be the view outside my window,
but who painted it?
thrilling my heart as any painter might --

Striking awe into a being
now silent.
