#+title: Bridalveil Falls

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Looking up we saw a face,
clear, bold and gazing at the sun.

Its deep lines bespoke countless years;
its running fall of tears, a joyful sadness.

It was the face of a mountain,
Now ten thousand years old,

Capturing what all faces from the beginning of time have known:
Wonder, awe and the patience of long years;

Surprise, astonishment and the mute wonder we feel
When we imagine how all of it came to be.
