I've mentioned before that perhaps spirituality consists of the degree to
which one has truly recognized the Manifestation of God, and devoted
themselves to His instruction. In this vein, an analogy occurred to me that
could describe how self, or *nafs*, fits into the picture.

Imagine Albert Einstein had decided to give an advanced course on physics at
the University. As a student attending the class, it is impossible to really
appreciate who Einstein is -- apart from reputation -- until the class is over
and all its material absorbed. That is, during the process of learning, a
student must *necessarily* fail to appreciate the depth of his master, else
their roles should be reversed. And the greater the teacher, the greater this
gap.

Thus, the most important thing for a student to progress is to eliminate
everything he thinks he knows about the subject, whenever his teacher tells
him he does not understand something. This includes not only facts, but also
opinions, ideas, and his very conception of the subject. If Einstein tells us
that the Earth travels in a straight line, and not in circles around the Sun,
we should discard our thoughts immediately, and ask: why was our understanding
so flawed?

"Self" is that impulse within us to hold onto ignorance as if it were
knowledge, despite being corrected by the very Source of knowledge. There is a
strange obstinacy in us, perhaps a defense mechanism?, that interferes
terribly with the learning process if we are not fully committed to being
changed. In fact, this tendency must "die", so that knowledge may be "born",
since the deepest understandings are highly abstract and subtle, and requiring
shifts in perception that cannot occur unless we are willing.

In a spiritual context, the Divine Educator has gifted us with a perfect
knowledge, but we cannot receive it until every last trace of misconception is
eliminated; and our tendency to cling to shadows, in spite of the rising Sun,
is put to rest.
