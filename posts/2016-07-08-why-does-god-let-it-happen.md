It is sometimes thought that while life could be wonderful, mankind is just
too flawed, corrupt or generally inept; or that the world we've built is
essentially broken, and the best we can do is struggle for whatever mote of
peace we're able to find.

In this picture of the world, God's Messengers are seen as agents of a
merciful, but distant Entity, sent to help us fix what our sins has wrought.
But with time, even the institutions They bring are perverted by man. Evil
runs rampant, the innocent are oppressed, sorrow and hardship afflict the
least deserving, and where is God? Why aren't His Messengers a bit more
effective, so all this heartache can end at least? Why does God let it all
happen?

In the mystical Writings of the Bahá'í Faith, we find indications that not
everything is as it seems: that there is a deep perfection in the scheme of
the world, even with its wars and venomous anger. It suggests we might "attain
a station wherein one seeth no distinction amongst His creatures and findeth
no flaw in the creation of the heavens and the earth."[1]; that a wayfarer on
the path of God "seeth in the fashionings of the True One nothing save clear
providence, and at every moment saith: 'No defect canst thou see in the
creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze: Seest thou a single
flaw?'[2]"[3]

> "O Fleeting Shadow! Pass beyond the baser stages of doubt and rise to the
> exalted heights of certainty. Open the eye of truth, that thou mayest behold
> the veilless Beauty and exclaim: Hallowed be the Lord, the most excellent of
> all creators!"[5]

To make sense of these statements, it is necessary to reorient our thinking
about the purpose of this life. If we imagine its aim to be our personal
happiness and joy, it is hard not to see the world as a miserable joke for all
but the favored few. However, this perspective fails to make sense of
existence because it chooses a wrong center: human beings. It revolves the Sun
of Truth around man's sense of well-being, and diminishes virtue by favoring
more immediate concerns, such as health and long-life.

If we correct this perspective, and interpret our motions in reference to a
central Sun, we may find that creation was purpose-built with a singular
objective: for mankind to truly recognize the Manifestations of God, a
recognition that only begins with accepting their Mission and has no end in a
person's life. We are most sensitive to light when plunged in darkness, and
our heart is attuned to even minute joys when sadness abounds. How can a man
know God, if real knowledge is only gained through contrast? In a way, this
existence is as "not God" as it is possible to be, so that with parched and
thirsty lips we may drink one drop of the Divine Elixir -- the Writings of His
Holy Ones -- and recognize Its savor in an instant.

Suffering is very real, but against eternal life it is unreal. None of us can
remember the pains we suffered as infants; why should our souls remember the
sorrows of this brief existence across eternity? We have a precious chance in
this life to know and to worship God, based entirely on our faith and our
choosing. There is a beauty and merit to this that will never, ever come
again. As Rumi wrote, "Don’t seek the water; increase your thirst."

Maybe paradise is not something you enter after you die; maybe paradise is
what you discover once you see the world aright.
