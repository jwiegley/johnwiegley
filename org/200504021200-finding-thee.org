#+title: Finding Thee

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I turned my sight unto myself
and found You
standing within me.

How long I pursued your fragrance --
sweet Joseph of my heart! --
only to find: I was that bouquet.

Should a masterpiece ask of itself,
"Where is Mastery? Where is Art?"
Behold: they stand within thee!

Man is the Supreme Talisman.
If he hath not known himself
how can he know Thee?

He seeks Music: he is an instrument!
He prays for Light: he is a lamp!

Fruitless, he labors tirelessly,
straining every muscle
to know the meaning of Effort --
  and still he does not know...

Ponder a moment this thought:
How can a man know completion
if what he seeks is "the Sought"?
