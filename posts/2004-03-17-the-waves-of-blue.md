    Remind me of that time
    when the brilliance of dreaming
    was the color of a sunrise;

    When the rippling waters of Glacier Lake
    and the waves of blue
    that gathered at my toes

    Were exactly what my heart desired,
    on a warm day,
    beneath the pale clouds of a lazy summer.
