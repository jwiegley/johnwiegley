| The wind... the wind...
| I remember the scent of the wind:
| catching up the leaves into whirls of
|   red and brown,
| gathering their varied fragrances of
|   oak and pine, dogwood and cherry.
|
| Their colors were like apricots,
| mulberries or marmalade:
| Scattered bits of potpourri flame,
| floating along, swept by the wind...
