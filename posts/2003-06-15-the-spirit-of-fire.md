    Can we say that fire has a spirit?  
    Its sensual dance  
    on toe-tips  
    that barely touch the wood.  
    Its crimson blush,  
    orange eyes sparkling,  
    the drifts of its hair  
    flying madly on the breeze.  
    The swift moves of its dance  
    that slowly push the wood down  
    pulverizing it to ashy dust.  
    Can such activity  
    have no spirit behind it?  
    A dancer so intent  
    that as I close my eyes  
    I watch his flickering imprint  
    continue the motion.
