    Don Juan Matus!

    You call us from our everyday thoughts:
    and we puzzle over bird-calls
    and candle-lights flickering.

    Each time we summon up
    the mundane task
    that brought us to your door,

    We are plunged back into the mists again,
    musing on the solitary flights of Venus...
