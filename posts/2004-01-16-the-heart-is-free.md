    Should the moon settle on the waters
    appearing bright among the waves,
    and lead the mind to tranquil thoughts
    of earlier times, and younger days,

    Remind the heart: it's still free yet:
    there's nothing lost that's not been gained;
    it's simply how we look on things
    that sometimes feels restrained.
