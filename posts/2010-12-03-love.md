    When you love,
    you embrace change;
    you welcome change;
    but you don't desire change.

    When you love,
    every day is deeper;
    each day is greater;
    but it's always enough.

    When you love,
    a drop is more refereshing than oceans;
    a crumb is more than a feast;
    one moment, longer than eternity.
    And yet, it's never enough.
but you don't desire change.


...a drop is more refereshing than oceans;


a bite is more than a feast;


...And yet, it's never enough.
