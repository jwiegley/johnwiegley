title: The concept of ownership

The concept of ownership is one that holds true only when the scope of
consideration is the individual himself.  Broadened to encompass
society, however, the spending of money to acquire goods should more
accurately be stated as "paying off social power to act on one's
behalf."

That is, if we were to go into a TV store and pick up a TV, without
buying off society, it would, ultimately, bring all of its force to bear
upon us for trying to steal from it.  However, when we hand over the
requisite sum of dollars, it will gladly let us walk away with the TV.
Therefore, the money paid does not make me owner of the TV, but
purchases the complicity of social power in my taking it.

Seen this way, that money is only a contract with the current social
power, it seems that there is no "owning" whatsoever.  If the regime
changes hands, all previous contracts may be annulled.  Furthermore, if
I spend my life in pursuit of financial gain, what I'm really doing is
trying to stack up bargaining chips in order to social power according
to my wishes.  In a sense, I am then playing to its tune.  It is the
strong-arm of the law, and I a lowly citizen trying to drum up enough
money for it to heed my voice.

But social power can serve *us*.  If we use money to direct social power
toward the benefit of society, rather than ourselves exclusively, then
rather than paying off the social bully to leave us alone, what we're
doing is directing his energies toward strengthening the very basis of
his own power -- the people who make up the society.
