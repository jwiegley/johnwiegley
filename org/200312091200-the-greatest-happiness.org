#+title: The greatest happiness

If (name here) is the soul's fulfillment, it represents the greatest
joy, the true happiness. And if this is so, we'd choose it over
everything else -- almost without choice.

Thus the way to correct behavior is not to focus on behavior, but to
find a goal whose nature will enliven us to make the choices leading to
it. It is a backward way to approach self-perfection, but far more
likely to succeed because it is inspiring, and never dispiriting.

For example, you can learn how to sail by reading a book; you can learn
it from a class. You can even go out on the boat and have someone teach
you. But no matter how much you learn, it's still just knowledge without
a goal.

If you fall in love with sailing, however, and feel the taste of the sea
in your heart, you might long to go deeper into it. You'd want to learn
about the boat and the sea intimately. You would naturally start doing
whatever was needed to enrich your /connection/, not just your knowledge
and your skills. (All of which are a means to the goal, but fade away as
you near its presence).

In other words: If the heart is dry and ready, find a match. Everything
else makes much more sense after that. To do the opposite, to make
choices according to an idea of something we haven't seen, is too
difficult. If it does work, it's the grace of God: Perhaps all that
effort can spark love after all -- yet even then, what causes the real
transformation is when the fire catches, and not the efforts made up to
that time.

So the willingness of the heart, it's yearning: this is the key.
Whatever we understand or think about the goal -- until we've tasted its
waters -- is only preparation and delay.

This is my doctrine of "no shoulds": If we bend our lives according to
an idea of what should be, and not because we yearn for something
higher, what do we have? Without the heat of such love, what can sustain
our victory in this wintery night?

And the corollary of the doctrine: What will kindle this spirit is worth
every consideration; because light can find its way out from a lantern,
whereas a wonderfully wrought lamp, without flame, benefits no one.
