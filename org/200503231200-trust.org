Once, in another world,
I was sitting with the Shaykh of my spirit,
a great Master.

Next to us
a huge fire was roaring,
consuming all my books,
my belongings, even my clothes.

Then my Master said,
"Now cast yourself into the flames."
And so I jumped,
without a moment's hesitation.

To my great surprise, I was unburnt.
The flames were cold to the touch
although everything around me
was being destroyed.

I turned to my Master.
He was shaking his head.
"Alas, in the end you have failed me, my pupil."

"How did I not obey?" I asked.

He said, “Your failure was this:
Despite your claims of complete faith in me,
you expected to be burned.”
