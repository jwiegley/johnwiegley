    If all the world is perfect
    within a grander scheme,
    tomorrow's bitter cup
    is sweeter than it seems.

    If eyes be taught this Way
    of seeing past the veil,
    they'd find an end to pain;
    so would happiness prevail!

    For darkness hasn't essence
    to bear against the Light;
    whose first arrows of dawn
    are fatal to the night.

    Until they ask:
    Mustn't night, too, succeed day?
    To which I answer:
    The Sun never sets;
      it's the Earth that turns away.
