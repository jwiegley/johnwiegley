#+title: A borrowed tale

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The moon speaks of its faraway sun
in phrases of luminous rhyme and verse.
It has no better story to tell.
Its own form, the lines of its speech;
every action a reference,
every word a suggestion.
It is a great mouth of light
whose tale is the greatness of Another.
