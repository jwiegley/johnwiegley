    When the Master appears
    is a time
    for questions and answers:
      Your questions,
      His answers.

    Do not presume
    to know in His presence;
    do not even imagine
    you know what Knowledge is.

    Bow to your Sensei!!

    If he says you're hungry,
    feel your stomach growl;
    let His words
    become your reality.

    As long as you consider Him
    with your eyes
    you see a feeble man;

    As long as He looks at you
    with His
    He gives His counsel.
