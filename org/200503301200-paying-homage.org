#+BEGIN_VERSE
See how the wild daisy
bows in the wind?
But what does it make
obeisance to?

To you, looking on,
it pays homage
to nothing at all.

So come closer --
still closer --
until you too
feel the breath of Wind
on your face.

Only then can you know
whether that flower
is a wise one
or a fool.
