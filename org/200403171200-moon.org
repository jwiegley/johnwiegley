#+BEGIN_VERSE
The moon lives up there,
  so far away,
    so detached,
      so disinterested.

I imagine it has no connection with us,
the living.

And then I think:
  there are so many poems written,
    so many songs,
      hearts inspired,
        minds turned thoughtful...

Looking from where I stand
it seems so very far away;
But reflecting more deeply:
it is more involved with life than I am.
