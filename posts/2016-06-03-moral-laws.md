On its own, a violin is just string, wood and glue; but played well, it can produce wonderful music.

To play that music, however, requires many things to be done well: the way you hold it, how it is tuned, the way the bow is held, timing, pressure, etc. There are many things that must be done right to achieve the greatest music.

Human beings are instruments of God. We are capable of things you cannot even dream of. The moral laws are how we coax those mysteries from our own selves, but they are not the music. Honesty, trustworthiness, sacrifice, service: They are the key to a door, hidden within our inmost nature.
