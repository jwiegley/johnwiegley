When we look at the world, we notice many qualities in varying degree, such as
power, strength, durability, mass.  And when we read about God's omnipotence
and perfection, we naturally project the scale of those degrees to their
uttermost limit: that God is ultra-powerful, unthinkably strong, impervious to
harm, etc.

However, it is a mistake to make gods out of those qualities themselves.  It
is one thing to see "goodness" in world, and imagine God to be perfectly good;
but another to question His existence based on whether He measures up to our
understanding of the Good or not.  *To believe in goodness over God* -- likely
because goodness is something we actually experience -- means that if God
fails to act as we imagine a good God to be, it follows He is either not
perfectly good or not God.

What I read in Scripture, however, points to a deeper mystery: that God's
perfection does not allow for attribution.  Consider light.  In the darkness,
when one cannot see, light illumines and makes things visible; but if there is
too much light, it turns to pain and blindness and is actually worse than the
darkness itself.  It is not that the light has failed, but rather that our
eyes have a very limited range within which to perceive its benefits.  Our
perception of its virtue is defined by our limitations.

Or as children: our parents often did things we felt were unfair or unwise,
imagining their failure to comprehend the complexities of our little world.
What we lacked was a proper perspective to measure those actions.  How, then,
can we hope to measure or judge what is infinite?  How can we know even the
least bit of good in anything God does?  If a flea sits on Beethoven's head,
does he appreciate the mastery of his art?  He only knows what reaches him,
and according to his own understanding and capacity.

So God cannot be judged or measured.  It does not matter what He does, or
whether we see it as good or evil.  He created the concept of goodness and so
is above and apart from it.  What He does is good by His doing it, since
goodness follows from His actions and not vice-versa.  The implication is that
He does not have to be logical, consistent, or fair in any way, as there is
never a time when He must live up to our understanding of what is right or
fair.

To be the creature of an infinitely powerful Being, not bound by any moral
stricture I'm able to imagine; Whose actions, perfect beyond all
comprehension, seem capricious to my finite mind, isolated from the Grand
Design; Whose motives remain consistently obscure and impenetrable; and Whose
merest intention could render my existence naught, or effect a change even in
my thoughts without my noticing His influence; these considerations make it
only natural for me to want to instinctively bind God, to imprison Him in my
idea of what is just and true -- simply to be free from considering what He is
truly capable of, at any and every moment, and that by His doing so it expands
our definition of what justice looks like.

And Bahá'u'lláh wrote:

I cannot find my way through this mystery, but at the very least I can
acknowledge and respect it.
