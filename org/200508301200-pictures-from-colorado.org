#+title: Pictures from Colorado

The other day I had a chance to go hiking with my father at the Seven
Falls park in Colorado Springs. There are several photographs from the
hike we took [[file:gallery/Colorado/Seven%20Falls/index.html][here]].
And no, there are no people in the pictures! As a few have noticed, my
artistic side resonates more with the idea of an empty landscape.
