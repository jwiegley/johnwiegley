title: The Faith to me

What I think everyone should know is that the Bahá'í Faith believes
every human being to be an infinitely beautiful light, albeit trapped
within a lantern of iron: the obscuring dross of self and material
desires. If this light became generally known and appreciated, the
character of our planet would change in ways we cannot dream of. Forget
ending wars and establishing world peace: when all people, everywhere,
begin working together to explore reality and discover the mysteries of
existence, can you imagine what that will be like? We are like
thoroughbred race horses, blinded, hobbled and weighed down by
ignorance, prejudice and a litany of injustices committed by our fathers
for which we seek vengeance against every new generation.

The Bahá'í Faith is a liberation from present notions of humanity,
toward something almost too beautiful to contemplate. We are wondrous
beings, illumined souls, children of God. Our potential cannot be
measured. This includes each one of us on these forums, in every
country, from every group. All that awaits is for us to collectively
awaken to our reality, and apply the Teachings we've been given to
unlock these latent treasures.

O Son of Being! With the hands of power I made thee and with the fingers
of strength I created thee; and within thee have I placed the essence of
My light…

O Son of Utterance! Thou art My stronghold; enter therein that thou mayest
abide in safety. My love is in thee, know it, that thou mayest find Me
near unto thee.

O Son of Spirit! I created thee rich, why dost thou bring thyself down to
poverty? Noble I made thee, wherewith dost thou abase thyself? Out of the
essence of knowledge I gave thee being, why seekest thou enlightenment
from anyone beside Me? Out of the clay of love I molded thee, how dost
thou busy thyself with another? Turn thy sight unto thyself, that thou
mayest find Me standing within thee, mighty, powerful and self-subsisting.
