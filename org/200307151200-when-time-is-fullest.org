#+title: When time is fullest

#+BEGIN_VERSE
When time is fullest
it loses all meaning.
The hours go by in a moment
and every minute
is remembered as an hour.
It passes faster than notice,
and endures longer than possible.

Only when time is regular
every hour counting for an hour --
ourselves fully conscious of each --
does it bear any relation
to the passing of our lives.
