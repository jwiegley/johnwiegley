If the Manifestation only wished for people to know the truth of things,
this could be achieved with a single Word. So I do not think the
objective is our understanding. After all, does it change anything to
know whether Huri and Dijnn are figurative or literal?

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Within the treasury of Our Wisdom there lieth unrevealed a knowledge,
one word of which, if we chose to divulge it to mankind, would cause
every human being to recognize the Manifestation of God and to
acknowledge His omniscience, would enable every one to discover the
secrets of all the sciences, and to attain so high a station as to
find himself wholly independent of all past and future learning.

God gives to each soul a priceless opportunity to recognize Bahá'u'lláh
for His own sake, and not according to his own understanding. Since the
mind can never know God, or even the nature of its own self (!), the
heart is what is tested.

But I don't mean this in the sense of blind faith. Imagine an explorer
who believes something about the world around him, based on principles
he discerns without certain knowledge -- even when others tell him he is
wrong -- and who demonstrates his faith by acting on that knowledge. If
the truth of things were clear from the outset, the beauty of such
courage would never be.
