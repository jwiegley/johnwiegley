#+BEGIN_VERSE
when tragedy befalls the truly kind,
they look tenderly on their malefactor,
wondering more at the strange variety of God
than cursing the Hand of fate and glory.

when anguish settles into the heart of a lover
the only fear to cross his mind
is the discovery of this pain by his Beloved;
so he grips it tight, folding it into his bone.

when sorrow pays call on those who wonder,
sweet nostalgia is their only perception;
a remembrance of how things aren't, now,
filled with the mystery of how they could be.

life offers a full, four-course meal:
Let the hearty diners dig in.
