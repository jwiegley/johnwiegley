Listening to someone talk about "being in the present" the other day, I
found myself thinking that this idea is very strange.  We are always in
the present; there is nowhere else to be.  The idea of "being in the
present" has no meaning, because living can't be otherwise.

So what do people mean by saying it?  It seems to be telling us not to
do certain things: Don't think, feel; don't imagine, watch; don't
wander, attend.  And yet, the mental is as much a part of life as the
physical and emotional.  Understanding context is often what allows the
eyes to see, and the heart to feel.

Time is like reading a book.  The eyes can only be on one page at a
time.  Whatever page we're on is the present.  As we read, we turn the
pages, creating by that movement a past and future: what we've already
read, and what we have yet to read.  Past and future are always part of
the present; the present could not be what it is without them.

We read pages in order to read books.  A single page has little meaning
by itself.  Its meaning is a composite of what came before it, and what
will follow.  As we move through the book, we create a consciousness of
the story within ourselves, which is the act of reading.  "Being in the
present" would be like telling someone to focus on the current page,
whereas really attention is due to the story.

The ability to connect to a book's overall meaning through its pages is
a capacity of the intellect.  The pages together point toward an unseen
reality -- the story -- which the mind allows us to comprehend.  Paying
attention to life, then, requires a full use of the mind as well as the
senses.  No part can be rejected, if we hope to appreciate the whole.

What if life is a book, and time the turning of its pages?  What if
existence is God's auto-biography?  Then by looking to the connections
between things, perhaps we can read its deeper meaning.
