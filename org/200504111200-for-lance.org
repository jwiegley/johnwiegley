#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sunlight
where do you go?
I know that at dusk
you make the mountains glow.
Your last ray catches my eye
but I wonder:
why must you go?
Why leave me to the dark of night?
To the cold,
to the bitter hours...
The moon's a poor reflection;
the stars, a distant company.
Is my only hope to wait?
To trust we'll meet again?
My dear sunlight
where did you go?
