A long time ago I found that every truth I discovered about "God" was
also, in some way, a truth about "humanity", which in turn was a truth
about "myself". There is a realm in which all things have their proper
place and station; and there is another in which all things are united,
rays of the same Sun. Yet even these two realms are in harmony, like the
sides of a coin, and work toward the same purpose.
