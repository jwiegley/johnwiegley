#+BEGIN_VERSE
Even as mystery is an air
which surrounds us in the dead of night;

And silence has its own sound,
audible as a deafening roar
when truly we hear it deeply:

So everything about us has
a deeper nature,
a second skin,
which requires our utmost attention to perceive it.

Otherwise,
in the falling leaves of the redwoods
one sees nothing but those leaves,
and misses them for the wonderful tapestry they are.
