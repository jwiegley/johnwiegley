    And so it begins...
    The weaving of tapestries
      in threads of black ink

    These drops are now dried
    by a sun falling behind blue waters,
    though my heart rises when I write them.

    Soon the moon will accompany me
    down lanes of memory
    of the two of us toying with *sohbat*

    Memories of sweet Fariba, the spiny cactus,
    and dry winds that whisper across dry sands...

    Here there is the bellow of seals
    and the leaping of dolphins
    to catch my eye.

    Such different worlds.
