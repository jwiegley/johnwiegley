    I am a bow of strong wood
    with forceful potential.
    God has strung me
    and knocked the arrow of my soul
    pointed in His direction.
    As I learn, I pull it back,
    ever further, ever tighter.
    Now it is taut:
    to the breaking point.
    All that is left for me
    is to let go.
