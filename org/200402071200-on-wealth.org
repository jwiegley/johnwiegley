title: On wealth

Wealth is sometimes presented as the accumulation of riches. When we
ask, "Whom do we consider a wealthy man?", one often thinks of a man
with a lot of money and property. This implies that riches equal wealth;
or, that if one acquires riches he will be wealthy.

But even those who have money do not want just bigger numbers in their
bank accounts, but the things money can do for them. They want the
freedom that comes from wealth. So perhaps a more correct statement of
wealth would be: Wealth is when all of our needs and desires are met.
This phrasing implies two factors: The range of our needs and desires,
and the means needed to fulfill them.

Since there are these two parts, it is not true that riches equate to
wealth, but that wealth is the balance struck between our desires and
the means to achieve them. Therefore, wealth could be increased both by
increasing our means, or by decreasing the scope of our desires.
