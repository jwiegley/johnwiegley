#+BEGIN_VERSE
If a wise man speaks to a fool,
he will use the fool's language --
lest the language of the wise
lead him to greater folly.

Yet if the fool pays too much heed
to the words and forms adopted,
he will mostly see in them
the shape of his own reflection...

He should wonder less the form,
and more what could not fit it:

  Forget the drop, drying on your nose;
  ponder the clouds and thunder.
