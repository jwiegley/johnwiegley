#+BEGIN_VERSE
Alone, the night too black --
did a tear grace my upturned face?
or the mistake of a passing cloud.

Forgetful, I wander through memories
of friends, loves, joys gone by;
but the night is so cold, and morning far away...

Questions hurt, too sore questions,
rubbing raw at my heart's cage;
then a new moon rises, invisible, yet powerfully fey;

But strength finds no home in me, no hope!
A sigh is all I have left to give
as the night's wind carries my last tear away.
