#+BEGIN_VERSE
Far-away blue
farther than my sight reaches
hinting at the empty black of space beyond
so vast it loses its meaning.

The pen, the writer
this dot on paper
lost in the infinite blue.

I am less than a thought
less than the uncreated sentence
as much nothing
as the limitless arms of a night sky
embracing four trillion worlds.

Until the magic happens
the mystic's thaumaturgy
who blends in a formless soup the scene and seer
until both are one
and this shadow on a bright day writing
is christened "self"

A moment within the universe of who I am.
