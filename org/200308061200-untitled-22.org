Here's a little piece whose language style was inspired by Dickens'
"Great Expectations", a very cute book:

There is nothing like the sight of a katsu [a cat] to take up my whole
soul in one great hand, and squeeze for all the worth that may be had
from it -- and leave it by the side, panting and eager for breath, with
ever the katsu undisturbed in his peaceful repose. If I had ten-thousand
hands, and some way to manage the difficulty of so many fingers, I would
find myself still lacking the capacity to pet that katsu quite as much
as I would like to. And I can doubt he would sit through it all, stroked
to baldness, his tufts of hair catching on the breeze like a young boy
run through a field of dandelions in summer. Away he goes, my feline
hope, perhaps informed of my design by his guardian, whole, alight on
airy wings, shows himself equally fleet of paw, lest I should take note
of /him/, and change the object of my fancy...
