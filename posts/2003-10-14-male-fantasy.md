    To spread my seed into a woman  
    is like being buried in satin cloth.

    I like to feel her breasts under a soft sweater,  
    smell that indelible fragrance  
    which seems to mean: a loving woman.

    And then to feel her lips,  
    her biting at my neck,  
    the fine strands of her hair  
    against my eyelashes...

    I want to lean into her, warm and open,  
    and see the sparkle of her eyes  
      in understanding.

    She whispers something -- anything --  
    her voice is a hush;  
    it's a throaty quality I long to explore...

    Then a moment like no other:  
    a warm, narcotic sea.

    I cannot hold back;  
    but I do return, in memory,  
    often and again.
