#+title: Can God build a wall he cannot break?

This question rests on a false premise: It assumes there exists
something -- the building materials for a wall -- that is outside of
God's own existence. That is, God is here, the bricks are over there,
and you're asking if God, Who has no physical dimensions and is
unlimited, can then impose upon Himself both dimensions and limits.

It would be quicker to ask, "Can God be something other than God?" This
is only a little different from Russell's paradox, "Is there a set of
all sets that do not contain themselves?" Rather than saying something
meaningful about such sets, the paradox reveals that such a question is
simply not logical.
