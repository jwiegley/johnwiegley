title: A sun's love

    The sun's heart burns like fire cannot burn.
    Crossing the sky, it kneels to kiss the earth --
    and is swallowed by a wine-dark sea.

    We see everywhere the reason for the sun:
    It is life, light, time.
    But to it, are we larger than a pebble,
    circumambulating the mountain like a homesick flea?

    The sun's heart burns without purpose.
    It loves only to know love;
    showering the emptiness of space, unbounded,
    always giving, never conscious of return.

    Today, two white orbs, dotted with green
    reflect a light that can never be contained;
    swept a million miles into dream
    by a Heart more ardent than flame.

    Even as a sun's love finally
    created the hearts who adore it:

      Love only to love,
      and the Beloved will appear.
