Out of interest, took the
[[http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes2.asp][Meyers-Briggs
Personality Test]] today. I remember back in my college days I was
pretty strongly INTP. What surprised me is that the test now places me
as INFJ (indeed, many of the questions I answered differently now than I
would have back then).

I am only 1% away from the midline between Judging (INFJ) and Perceiving
(INFP), and found much of myself described by both categories. Also, my
introverted and intuitive aspects were rated as 22% from midline, while
feeling is 56% away from thinking (which corresponds to my
disenchantment in recent years with theory, and a greater desire to get
to know things by how they affect me, first-hand).

An interesting test, Meyers-Briggs is based on the same psychological
foundation as the book I have been reading by Jung. Whatever its
accuracy, what a person reads into it is bound to reveal something about
themselves.
