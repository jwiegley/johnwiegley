    I lived upon a landscape of broken crystal.
    My eyes were closed, and my feet, bleeding. 
    
    One day I awoke with the sun in my face...
    And I fell in love,
    and my heart became a mortal cup, filled with light.
    
    I looked across the land as the Daystar rose
    and all those crystal thorns became as one:
    drops of the sun,
    diamonds of fire,
    a treasure of light
    unbounded.
