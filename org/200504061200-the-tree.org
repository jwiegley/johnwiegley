The tree
digs its roots deep
drawing out
nourishment and means
from the Earth.

It stands tall
stretching out boughs
to receive the Light
that shines down
from Heaven.

It yields fruit
for others to live by;
gives shelter
to those below
and a home to those above.

It marries
the two Kingdoms
of ground and sky
into a beautiful
bountiful creation.

If a man
could learn
such secrets as these
he would know
his place in the world.
