    I believe now that
      spirituality is destructive.
    Destructive because it sweeps aside the ego,
    the way a drop of rain
    is flung from the sailor's brow
    into the sea;
    the way dust is pushed aside,
    without thought,
    to make a new foundation.

    I believe now that
      spirituality is constructive:
    In the manner of placing
    atop the candle's meager head
    a bright crown of flame
    by which he faces the dark,
    uncontested
    with his bold, new powers of illumination.

    Religion would teach this,
    but often fears it more than the rest.
    Not many things have the heart
    to court their own destruction...
    no matter the world
    that lies beyond the warm cocoon
    or the insistent pressure of new wings.
