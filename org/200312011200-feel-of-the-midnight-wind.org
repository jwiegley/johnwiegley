#+title: Feel of the midnight wind

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I know the feel of the midnight wind;
I know the touch of another's soul.
Both pass over, moving, changing
and feeding the fire within.

At once soft and profound,
silent and symphonous --
our wordless exchanges
touch eye and brow and heart with meaning.

Yesterday became what it should have been.
And now, the present forming between us --
I wonder if that late-night spent
was not the future as it ought to be.
