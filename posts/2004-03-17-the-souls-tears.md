    The eyes of the soul  
      do not weep.  
    Rather, they cry with the agony  
    of a thousand lives remembered.

    My life?  Your life?  
    Is it so different when I sigh that deeply?

    Or have I found in the mirror  
    one facet of that largest gem of all:  
    a precious stone they call humanity.
