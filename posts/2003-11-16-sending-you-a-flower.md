title: Sending you a flower

    I meant to send you a rose today;
    but the distance was too great.

    But not for words.

    And I began to wonder:
      how many letters before I match
      the softness of a petal's touch?
      How many thoughts, mulled together,
      can conjure up the image
      of lilies, waving in the spring?

    I know your heart is fertile,
    and its soil ready for the seed...
    Would not a single, quiet glance,
    suffice to set the rendezvous?

    Then here it is:
      be mine.
    I think the silence says the rest.
