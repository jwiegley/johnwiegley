    Whom do I write to now?  
    Where can I send my complaint?

    Time has uncoiled like a serpent  
    whose fangs have felled my hopes.

    I await the next strike  
    the paralyzing blow  
    after which, I soon expect  
    to be swallowed whole.

    Are we all consumed so viciously?  
    Or is this choice delight  
    only for those who ask?

    Pray for His will  
    and you might find it:  
    unfolding in your life the way  
      a venus flytrap  
    responds to the slightest touch...

    He is a devourer of souls, a sacred flame  
    to burn all wooden forms of love!

      "He who is beloved of Me,  
      him shall I slay.  
      He who is slain by Me,  
      I Myself shall be his ransom."

    My partner is my pain tonight;  
    and somewhere in that: a compassion  
    whose depths I will never fathom.
