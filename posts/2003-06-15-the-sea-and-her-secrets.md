| Here is a chest whose lid we cannot grasp
| that needs no lock
| that rubs out the messages
| we send her on the sand.
|
| Even the sun cannot fathom her.
| Whole regions of permanent night,
| a wet fist clasping
| the very whole of Earth...
|
| The deeps that lie beneath
| are not for you and me.
| The pearls that gather eternally there
| will ever remain the secrets of the sea.
