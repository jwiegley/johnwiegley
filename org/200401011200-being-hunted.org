#+BEGIN_VERSE
What is it
that hounds me in the dark?
in the lonely hours,
in the still and secret places...

My heart is a hunter
that stalks my mind.

I hide in the daylight --
but when all is quiet
it still finds me.

I have heard it said:
“There is something about
the dark sanctity of the night
that beckons me.”

I fully agree.
