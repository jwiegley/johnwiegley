#+title: Seeking the soul-destroyer

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I am seeking the soul-destroyer!
whose ways rip and slash and burn.
As a moth calls out to the flame, I pray:

  Rain down your wrath from heaven;
  beseech Job a portion of his woes;
  grant the sea drown my sorrow
  and fire consume those who know.

O soul-destroyer!
Make my hands to me
works of an unknown God;
my own eyes a mystery,
my breath the bellows
of another's despair;
until my time here
is so filled with awe
that wonder prevents
all knowledge of its passing.

O soul-destroyer!
Teach me the ways of love
until I cradle Satan in my arms
and hear him weep
all the days of his evil away...
