    Globes of moonlight float along the water,
    fishes nibble at the morsels of light;
    I lean against the railing, hands pressed down,
    closing my eyes to remember the sight...

    Sail on, lonely barque, carry me far --
    Loose my spirit on the darkened seas!
    I'll hear no more of heaven and earth:
    only waves crashing and the constant breeze.
