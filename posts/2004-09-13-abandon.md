    When there is only God,
    there is not even what is not He.

    If I reach to touch that Ocean
    it will be a hand of watery form:
    that Ocean caressing its own waves.

    Of what use is all this striving,
    this development,
    if my longing is already satisfied?

    It seems there is a beauty to growing,
    and this is why we grow:
    that growth befits His Name "The Fashioner".
    Then, even my movement, my stillness,
    is a thing of service to Him.

    As for me, myself, alone -- this not-me --
    there is neither need, nor place, nor movement:
    only He.
