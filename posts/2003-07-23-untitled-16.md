As for living for one's self: It was a revelation to me to find this
hole inside my being, that my own soul was creating to escape from
itself.  I still do not know why, except that our instinct as children
is to imitate those around us.  In Rand's terms, I was doing exactly
what Peter Keating is doing: trying to eliminate the "I".  It is one
thing to act as though independent, and entirely something else to cease
referencing others.  The "others" used to play in my mind most of the
time -- in the form of dialoging with myself using their words and
logic.  Yesterday was one of the first complete days that I realized I
had almost never thought of anyone else -- except in terms of their
value to me -- or what they thought about me.  Yes, this is new to me,
in the degree that I mean it now.  It is so peaceful, sometimes I just
lay back on the stone railing at the Piazza della Signora, and fall
asleep there for a little while.
