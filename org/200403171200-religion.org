#+BEGIN_VERSE
Religion
teaches brotherhood, but divides men;
proclaims love, but breeds hatred;
calls for peace, but engenders war;
applauds charity, but hoards like a scrooge;
talks spirituality, but practices greed.

Then, obviously,
we are not talking about religion.

Religion is a delicate flower
man has crushed by his ignorance.
Now we look at that dead, brown relic,
and assume we know what it meant.

Yet... flowers always bloom again.
