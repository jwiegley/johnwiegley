#+BEGIN_VERSE
There came a day
when the blood in my veins
  turned to wine:
now I am always drunk;

When my eyes filled
  with a special light:
now I cannot see darkness;

When my waking life
  became as a dream:
now I am always soaring...

These things happened slowly
  and then quickly
the way a flower grows
for weeks and weeks
and one day suddenly blooms.

There is no one who is not growing
toward their heart's fulfillment.

Turn to the Sun,
drink the bountiful rains,
strive to push through that
  weighing soil...

The rest will happen of itself.
