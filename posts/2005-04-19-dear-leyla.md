| Dear Leyla,
| I wonder if your heart
| was really made here.
| So pure:
| a crystal globe
| that catches the sunlight
| and sparkles with a
| white, colorful fire.
|
| When I talk to you
| I swear,
| I hear the angels speaking.
|
| How did you come to be?
| Were you just there,
| one day,
| sitting by the road
| and your mother took you in?
|
| Dear Leyla,
| never change who you are.
| Just knowing you
| has taught me more
| about love.
