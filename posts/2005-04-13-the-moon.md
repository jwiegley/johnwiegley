    How strange that
    I sought you for so long;
    when Yours were the eyes
    I looked with all along...

    In Your voice, I cried out;
    on Your feet, I carried on;
    with Your mind
    I dreamt my troubled dreams.

    If only I'd paid
    more attention
    I might have noticed:

    Whenever You breathed, I exhaled;
    whenever Your eyes closed
    I laid myself to rest.

    If the moon believes
    it shines with its own light,
    yell up to Heaven: "Not quite!"

    If not for the Sun,
    we would know the moon only
    by its nothingness:
    the occlusion of nearby stars.

    Hence the mystic is nothing -- a void;
    when he shines you see only the Sun.

    He has no voice of his own;
    no feet to carry him on;
    no sight, no mind:
    All that he has is borrowed.

    Know who you are without Him
    and perhaps
      you will know Him without you.
