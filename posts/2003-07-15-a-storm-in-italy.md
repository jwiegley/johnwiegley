    Tonight there is a storm in Italy,
    angry in white shouts across the sky;
    its massive brow furrowing in cumulus piles
    grey upon black,
    throwing down water on the heads,
    leering, towering,
    a heavy fist that shakes in fury,
    wringing drops of its own, pallid blood
    on the earth below.
