#+title: Enter the night

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Wan sun is all that fills
the somber arch of the sky;
one Eye, closing in restful contemplation
of the denizens below;
one minute, before its last ray
jousts the sky, to be no more;
one instant -- a pause of fading day --
before acquiescing to enter the night.
