#+title: Catching a glimpse

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The wind one morning
carried Your voice to me;
but when I turned my head
  it was gone.

Looking up one night
a sparkling Light caught my eye;
but when I turned my head
  it was gone.

A fragrance on the breeze
enchanted both heart and mind;
but when I turned my head
  it was gone.

Until at last
the thought came to me:
  Why do I keep turning away?
