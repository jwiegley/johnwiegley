    Empty days, spotted nights of
    countless camphor drops
    or milky dew on a
    silent web of gossamer black.

    The cold night is home to
    so much fire -- a billion suns!
    too much light to belong
    to those depths of endless black.

    How could all those distant
    daylight worlds,
    taken together,
    sum to such a lonely, empty black?

    Perhaps their days are empty too
    all glimmer with no shine;
    sleeping midnight jellyfish, or
    white glowbugs trapped
    in a vast amber turned black.
