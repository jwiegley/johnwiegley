#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sails full, reaching out,
leaving the world of people
far enough behind to miss them.

The landscape is ever the same,
maintaining its similitude
though I've gone a hundred miles since.

The secrets she has to tell, this sea:
a patient listener, far deeper than
the querying blue eyes
that wait for me back home.
