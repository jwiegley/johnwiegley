    May true thoughts, like dawn's rosy fingers,  
    catch the tears your heart cannot hold back;  
    and with them, water those furrows, long-planted,  
    whose blooms accompany us through Life.

    Pain, my dear friend, is the sun's blazing love:  
    endurance alone can prove its healthy gift.  
    And yet, as the clouds gather and cover us,  
    so pleasure and hope reprieve of constant grief.

    Stronger, hardier, we ache toward a sky unreachable,  
    grasping at nothing our fingers can touch.  
    Yet I feel it within me: the blossom coming forth,  
    invisible to all, but known to the Gardener's Plan.

    One day -- ah, what day? -- these thorns so obstructing,  
    will shrink invisible next to a glorious Truth:  
    Oh Color! I cannot command you, or bid you hence,  
    you are the fruit of my Beloved's kiss;

    And yet, if I obey and heed your grand Design,  
    one day, some eye will feel your touch through me.
