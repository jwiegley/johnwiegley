#+title: You awoke them

#+BEGIN_VERSE
My sadness falls in sweetened drops
for thought of you provokes them;

If not these tears, I had not known,
what form of love evokes them;

My heart is stilled, its fires gone --
it waits your Hand to stoke them...

Now listen close and hear my pains:
I'd no such joy, till you awoke them.
