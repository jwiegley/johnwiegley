This world is joined to another, in the way that these words are joined
to the meaning behind them; and like these words, if you cannot read
them, or do not know the language or the concepts, you cannot access
that world. Both stem from the author's mind, while the words themselves
are only pigment. A mystic strives to learn the divine language, so he
may read the book of the world and apprehend its meaning; otherwise, it
is only atoms and coincidences.
