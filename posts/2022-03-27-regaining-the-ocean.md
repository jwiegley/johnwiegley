A wave is a creature of zero thickness, zero depth. It neither dives nor
departs. It's "not really there", except as a moving form given passing life
by time. It has form due to the ocean, while the ocean is the lone reality.
All the wave has to do is stop asserting its existence, or striving to regain
companionship with the ocean. In a moment, there it is, a tacit understanding,
and all is settled with nothing achieved.
