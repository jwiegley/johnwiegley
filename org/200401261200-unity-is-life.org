#+title: Unity is life

I ran across this quote today, which I like very much. It is by
`Abdu'l-Bahá, the son of the Founder of the Bahá'í Faith:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
... that which is conducive to association and attraction and unity
among the sons of men is the means of the life of the world of humanity,
and whatever causeth division, repulsion and remoteness leadeth to the
death of humankind.

#+END_QUOTE
