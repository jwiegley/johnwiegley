#+BEGIN_VERSE
When the smell of rain
is fuller than the rain itself...

When one drops fall
and then a thousand;
when the first bolt
divides the sky;
when a clap resounds
like the Hands of God;
and the water on your lips
fell from Heaven...

After the fury and the darkness
will shine every color
that eyes can see.
