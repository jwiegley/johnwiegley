#+BEGIN_VERSE
What expressions of love
  He deserves from me!
What better actions
  than those I perform!
What kinder words
  than what I've written!
What higher thoughts
  than my highest attempt!

My faith is bound
by the limits of my being.
Were it bound by the limits of His,
how could I remain?

Like a flickering flame
before the Almighty Sun:
I would suddenly disappear.
