#+BEGIN_VERSE
I lost myself to tomorrow.
The days landed like little birds
and carried my life away.

I'd lit a candle so tomorrow could find me --
since the night was restless and dreamless --
but I'd used the hours of my life to feed the flame.

I ate bread and meat to keep my strength up,
to be ready when He came.
But my own flesh is all I had for food.

I never made it till dawn.
I'd stoked the fire with my last few bones,
and used my skin to build a shelter.

When He found me, there was nothing left.
The little birds had taken it all away.
I'd lost myself waiting for tomorrow.
