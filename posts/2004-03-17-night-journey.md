| Blue and black it all becomes
| as the moths begin their night journey.
|
| I have never found peace when I looked for it;
| but when I rest from the task, somehow, it finds me.
|
| I'm never able to summon joy at my command;
| but when I cease demanding, and let things be, there it is.
|
| A smile is an awful thing to force;
| but a ray of errant sun when it appears.
