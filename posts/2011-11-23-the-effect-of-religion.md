I think the spiritual world is real, but it is like a seeing man looking for
the sun in a cave.  Until he leaves the cave, no report, however accurate,
will convince him that the sun is anything more than a description.

If it weren't real, how to explain the dramatic changes in society that have
taken place after each religion was founded?  Christ walked around and talked
to people, informally, for three and a half years.  A carpenter, a son without
a father, poor.  And yet, not only did He utterly transform the Roman Empire,
but His legacy remains world-embracing to this day.

How many philosophers have labored for decades to produce a change in the
world's affairs, only to end in futility, or be remembered for their thoughts
without producing any actual change?  Plato's masterpiece, the Republic, has
yet to create a single enduring city with even a passing resemblance to his
hopes.

If wish-fulfillment alone were this powerful, how to explain the utter failure
of millions of self-help books to alleviate the inner difficulties of the
world?  If the soul were so easily satisfied, religions should be popping up
left and right.  Who doesn't want a piece of the pie that the Catholic church
and the mosques rake in every day?

One man, for three and a half years, talking briefly to the people around him.
Think about that.  Another man, exiled from His home city, built up a band of
Arabian followers and fought a few battles with them.  So many generals have
done more; why isn't Aurelius -- a devoted supported of Stoicism -- as
remembered?

And the Báb, who went on a pilgrimage, proclaimed Himself to be the Promised
One, then spent several years in prison until He was executed.  His ministry
did not last seven years!  And yet, look at the effect: tens of thousands not
only went to their deaths, but laughed during torture, kissed the hands of
their executioner, gave them money and gifts.  When has blind fanaticism ever
yielded such generosity of heart in the midst of suffering?  When has it led
to consideration for one's enemies, to sacrificing one's own life in order to
honor the faith of his enemy?

If you look to the original history of each of the world's religions, you will
find a quality that no one has learned how to reproduce.  Perhaps because
there is something deeper involved?  Because, although mystical experience can
sometimes be explained in psychological terms, there is a truth involved that
can't be captured by description?

The whole point of seeking is to find.  This is not an easter egg hunt in an
empty field.  The reason you bring up these questions -- why so many people do
-- is because the question hasn't been answered to your satisfaction.  But why
would God create such a hunger, and not provide the food?  Every creature's
desire has a fulfillment: why would our souls be an exception to this rule?
