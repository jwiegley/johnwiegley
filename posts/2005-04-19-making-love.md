    I'm sitting here  
    at this proper dinner party.  
    But I can't help noticing  
    the fit of the chair beneath me;  
    how the breeze from outside  
    brushes against my skin...

    The chocolate on my fork  
    is a kiss on the lips,  
    and the sweet music  
    woos me with its song...

    How funny, that despite  
    all these people around me --  
    You still find ways of making love.
