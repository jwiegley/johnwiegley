#+title: Purpose

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Whenever I have thirsted
though my tongue sought water
my soul sought for this.

Whenever I have yearned
though my dreams dreamt of futures
my soul dreamt of this.

Whenever I have labored
though my efforts aimed higher
my soul aimed at this.

Whenever I have swooned
though my heart longed for beauty
my soul longed for this.

Experience is a gilt onion.
I peel it back, layer by layer,
and always I find this.

This is the purpose.
This is the meaning.
This is the intent.

Perhaps you wonder what I mean?
In truth, you wonder about this.
