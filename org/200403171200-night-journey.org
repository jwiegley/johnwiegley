#+BEGIN_VERSE
Blue and black it all becomes
as the moths begin their night journey.

I have never found peace when I looked for it;
but when I rest from the task, somehow, it finds me.

I'm never able to summon joy at my command;
but when I cease demanding, and let things be, there it is.

A smile is an awful thing to force;
but a ray of errant sun when it appears.
