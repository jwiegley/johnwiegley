    That night, when my head was back,  
    counting stars in the awesome blackness of the sky,

    I remember you wondered at my strangeness --  
    why I waited so long to leave.

    Perhaps love isn't a thing common  
      to a child's heart,  
    but what I knew then, I still know now:

    The rest is up to you.
