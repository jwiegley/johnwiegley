title: Giving up beliefs

I think true faith means being willing to give up every one of your beliefs in
the name of truth. Because truth is the truth, and your beliefs are just...
your beliefs. One is absolute and independent, while the other is relative to
what you know, understand and perceive.

This doesn't necessarily mean that one day you'll stop believing in God, or
not God, or whatever is most important to you; but your beliefs about it
should change as you progress in life, because beliefs are, after all, mostly
ideas. The thought that one's beliefs wouldn't change in the face of new
knowledge and experience isn't faith, it's blindness.

Faith is knowing that someone loves you, and is absolutely good, even if they
act in a way that seems 100% the opposite. This is because you have faith in
the person, and so choose to believe that you haven't fully understood the
situation.
