It strikes me how earnestly many of us strive for ultimate acceptance.  I see
it in people's words and actions; in self-recrimination; especially in hopes
and dreams.  Most commonly there is an effort, according to some plan, to
"reconfigure" ourselves to match an idea of perfection.  It's thought if we
attain this longed for state -- whether it be clarity of mind or heart, an act
of greatness, a sublime moment of complete resignation -- that God will nod
His head, and something may occur to make us whole again.

Considering the extent of work involved -- to such minute degree as how one
thinks during prayer, or sits, or envisions God -- it occurs to me the real
key is not one of change.  Rather, the answer to the unsolvable conundrum is
to realize, deeply, fully, in both mind and heart and with real faith: that
God's grace far exceeds our gratitude.  He is a better Host than we are
guests.  "No man that seeketh Us will We ever disappoint."  A child does not
convince his parent to love him; his foolish words and deeds only increase the
flow.

When this gate unlocks, a river of mercy pours into our castigated hearts.
And I believe *this* is the time to seek perfection of character.  Not because
it stands between us and heaven, but as fulfillment.  Michaelangelo did not
seek ready-formed blocks of marble, but rough, unhewed ones.  He already knew
what the stone contained.  And at the moment the bond formed between master
and ingredient, a long process of refinement began so its beauty might shine
out.

We are all rough and unmade stones as well.  Should we form ourselves into an
idea of what is best, and then present ourselves to our Maker?  Or should we
submit entirely to His hand; let His words trace their impression upon our
grain; and thus gradually, through a process of deep communion and cleansing,
reveal what luster lay beneath.
