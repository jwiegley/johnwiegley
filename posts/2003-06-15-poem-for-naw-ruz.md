    Naw-Rúz, Naw-Rúz, calls the Live Oak  
    in hand signals of turning leaves,  
    in flashing, green smiles  
    at the earlier rise of day.

    And the crickets, in symphony,  
    and the flocks, in northern flight --  
    in the irresistible taming of the wind:  
    the year is changing.

    Nature's cold indifference  
    again remembers her charge,  
    sending fruit baskets and bright bouquets,  
    inviting a debuttante Earth  
    to the gala of her resurrection.

    Naw-Rúz, Naw-Rúz, the year is your domain!  
    and this one day: the crown,  
    the garland, and the praise,  
    to befit so everlasting a King.
