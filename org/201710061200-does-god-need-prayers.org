title: Does God need our prayers?
tags: journal

A flower opens its petals and prays to the sun, not because the sun
needs it.

The sere grass is grateful for a falling rain, not because the clouds
need it.

If we understood the nature of our soul's relationship to God, prayer,
reverence and gratitude would never feel forced upon us. They are the
natural order of things, once one takes into account the spiritual
world. Perhaps they are required of us at the beginning so we can derive
some benefit from them, before having understood.
