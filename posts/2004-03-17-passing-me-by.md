title: Passing me by

    I repose with sadness
    beneath a canopy of memories;
    and watch my life -- how it unfolded --
    wondering exactly who lived it?

    Not all the sentiments were mine;
    not all the thoughts would I agree with.
    As if a ghost had given me his memories,
    and left me to contemplate them for a while.

    What frightens me is that this ghost
    intends to continue using my body.
    But I shall not let it!  I shall awake!
    The life of unawareness is too small for us both.
