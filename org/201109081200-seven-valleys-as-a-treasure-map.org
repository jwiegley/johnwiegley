title: Seven Valleys as a treasure map
tags: journal

When I was a kid, I remember being strangely fascinated with the idea of
treasure. I used to spend hours outside my home in Virginia, walking up
and down the creek beds looking for gold. I would even sift the sand
searching for gold nuggets, little realizing how slim my chances were of
finding it there.

This obsession was fairly intense, as I recall, and led to an interest
in leprechauns, pirates, sunken ships, and stories like the lost city of
El Dorado. There was some crossover into the world of gems and
minerology, and later into coin collecting. But I never did find the
treasure I was looking for; not in any sense my childhood mind would
have recognized. Now that I think on it, it seems pretty obvious it was
my soul expressing its longing, trying desparately to remember something
it had only recently forgotten.

When I found the Seven Valleys, it struck me almost immediately as being
like a treasure map. Using it, one could traverse the inner jungle of
his self, mark the waypoints, check his inner compass, and look for the
telltale signs of drawing near.

It took a while to understand that this journey ends in Bahá'u'lláh, the
Ancient Beauty, "the goal of every aspiration"; and that the course of
this journey is one of recognition, in the Platonic sense: of unveiling
the soul until it remember its primal origin. It is the cloak of self --
so necessary for learning what is not God in order to appreciate Him --
that we gradually shuck, to discover that a ray of His Own light is the
truth of our illumination.
