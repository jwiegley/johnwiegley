#+title: "The Last Samurai"

Saw the movie "The Last Samurai" tonight. It transported me. The way it
depicted a land of soulful beauty, and people devoted to honoring that
beauty in every action of there lives, spoke to me deeply. I have a
newfound respect for Tom Cruise now too, and the way he was able to
portray someone coming into contact with that world and falling in love
with it.
