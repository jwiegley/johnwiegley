    Liberate me from the woe,
    the travesty of life,
    that describes my everyday pursuits.
    Everyone so eager,
    as if they saw victory around the bend.

    Yesterday, I met my manager on the street,
    jobless,
    and the human being he once was
    was no longer there.

    Vacant like a seashell
    gathering the sea's wind.
    What had he lost
    but that anxiety of working life
    which I realize now defined him?

    Thus, liberate me:
    Liberate the boring, tedious,
    jobless me.
    So that it may break from lethargy,
    escape the death of atrophy,
    and perhaps one day
    my life will find its meaning.
