#+title: City lights

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The city is strung with lights,
pearls of white, yellow,
glowing brilliantly
as the sun sinks
in the western hills.

Lying on my side,
watching the city fall to sleep,
my thoughts wander across the ocean,
wondering if your smiling eyes
wouldn't dazzle me the more.
