    I have spoken to a few of the wise ones  
    who journey after God.

    They speak often of the length of the journey;  
    of its perils and subtle trials;  
    of their longing, and deep ardor.

    So many, it seems, are on their way;  
    so few, it seems, are arriving.

    Perhaps the problem here  
    is that they sought what they sought;  
    for what man can discover God?

    Perhaps the answer lies, instead,  
    in seeking what He seeks...

    If a child wants truly to learn of  
    the world of his father,  
    he must put away childhood  
    and become a parent.

    But in doing so,  
    though he learn the lessons of fatherhood  
    it is no longer the child who knows it.

    There is no way for one world, so apart,  
    to become another.

    So too, a man who would find God  
    must leave himself to begin that journey.  
    Yet it would no longer be him, when he arrives.

    Does a parent long for the child  
    to leave his own state  
    and join him in his?

    Or would he rather be a parent  
    spending time with his young ones...

    In truth, he wants what all fathers  
    wish for their children:  
    that which best suits the child.

    One world, looking over the other,  
    fulfilling itself  
    by wishing the fulfillment of the other.

    I think all this journeying of the wise  
    is to a place with no reality:  
    like a seed wanting to know the Tree  
    who ceases to be in that knowledge.

    Such a thing *is* a long, impossible journey  
    for the seed.

    Perhaps it were better  
    if we sought what seeds should know:  
    and in this Way,  
    learn the mysteries of growth...
