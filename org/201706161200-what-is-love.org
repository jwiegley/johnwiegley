#+title: What is love?

The question "What is love?" has a simple and immediate answer, but can
never be shared and no one has ever understood it -- though lovers
consider it as plain as breathing. And just as studying books and
practicing will not help you find it, neither will not studying and not
practicing. Seek with openness, and it may find you, but the seeking is
not the cause, and the moment of finding is not the desired result.
Anyone who wishes to strip love of its mystery will lose if they win,
and win if they lose. After the log meets the fire, it discovers purpose
in watching itself disappear.
