    Behold!
    I am the Moth Satan
    wreathed in flame.

    I glow with a heat
    only lovers
    can comprehend.

    My scepter
    is my burning limbs;
    my crown,
    my blazing brow;
    my throne,
    the torment
    that surrounds me...

    Behold!
    I am the Moth Angel --
    for fire and love
    have made me king.
