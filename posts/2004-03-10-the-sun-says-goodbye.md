title: The sun says goodbye
category: Poems

    So gentle, the sun's light,
    moving slowly into evening;
    with her words, "I love you," just as softly,
    echoing in my ear.

    Young rabbits all white, and baby kittens,
    are playing with my soul;
    while I watch the last, golden ray
    disappear beyond the rise.
