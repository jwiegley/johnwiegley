| Sufficient knowledge has lead to me to a place of no knowledge.
| Sufficient wisdom has made me a fool.
|
| Enough vision, and I see the smallness of my nature;
| enough abandon, and my heart's fire compares with suns.
|
| How to understand the being that is left
| when my being is washed away?
|
| If one sit in a library, surrounded by books,
| should he consider them *his* knowledge?
|
| At an instant he retrieves whatever learning you seek,
| and can discourse in the lofty tongues of ancients!
|
| Should we regard the halls of memory any different?
|
| If one ask a question, we withdraw the relevant item,
| and relay what was heard or thought another day.
|
| If this is the hallmark of knowledge, whoever visits a library
| should claim the rank of scholar!
|
| Or do I see the lens of my eye as "mine",
| differently from a telescope?  Both can be taken away.
|
| Or the noble horse, who carries us great distances:
| is he "we" when we ride upon him?
|
| Yet we charge through life on a steed of bodily form,
| and gaze at the world through fixed eyepieces of the skull,
|
| And refer to mundane knowledge by humble requests
| of our own, uncomprehended memory!
|
| Bit by bit, as I understand the nature of my understanding,
| and discover the borrowed qualities of my being --
|
| I find that my understanding has made me ignorant,
| which implies that to know means knowing by other means.
|
| That is, to hear without ears, for I have none.
| to see without eyes, for I am blind;
|
| To know without knowledge, or memory,
| to travel without moving -- for where am I?
|
| This is  attaining without changing state:
| for what is there to change?
|
| What was something becomes nothing -- becomes all.
|
| If knowledge is but a symbol of knowing --
| as the Beloved's hair is proof of His raven Locks --
|
| What lies beyond this borrowed self,
| when we "see not even `neither first nor last'"?
