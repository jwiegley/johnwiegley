#+title: Shout out to the old school

Back when the Apple IIe was /the/ machine for home computing, and every
geek knew his 65C02 opcodes like the back of his hand, I used to
co-sysop for my friend Ted on his bulletin board, /The Magnetic Page/.
Back then, almost twenty years ago, I was Little John, and had a host of
friends whom I never met in person. I wonder where those guys are now,
and what they're up to... So here are a few hellos to:

- Ben, the Phantom
- Ted, the Pook
- Rich, the Data Wizard
- Rob, the Ghost
- Rusty, Blue Adept
- Bob, the Saltine
- Roman, the Crasher
