Yes, in just an hour I go to the train station and begin the long
journey home.

My emotions are all of joy, since I look forward to returning home and
doing the things that may be done there. One thing this trip has taught
me is that the Parent of all beauty is One, and thus there is equally
the same Beauty there as there is here. It is always in different forms,
of course, and for this travel is excellent; but the essence is One,
meaning it is possible to commune with the wonder of life anywhere, if
one is open. In that sense, I do not regard this place as special --
simply different. And when I come to the States, I want to enjoy the
States, just as I've enjoyed here while I'm here.
