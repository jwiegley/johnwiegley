    Happiness is the real real.  
    It is the fire in the dark of night --  
    the sound of the Loved One's name.  
    Consider it the endless blue  
    when the last cloud has gone.

    And that blue, that emanation:  
    whence comes the light?  
    That you may know:  
    the soul is the looking  
    and the feeling  
    of the forms of the Looked Upon.

    You carry within you,  
    by the signature of your own reality,  
    full knowledge of the beginning and end.

    When these two purposes --  
    Hoped For, and hope --  
    find their harmony,  
    then happiness gives reason for it all.

    Pure, unwritten;  
    not theories or words.  
    Until you know it  
    without reference to knowledge,  
    life must remain a mystery.
