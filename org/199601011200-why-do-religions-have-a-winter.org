title: Why do religions have a winter?
tags: journal

Why is it that every Dispensation has a winter? A time when the fortunes
of the Faith have reached their fullest consummation, and it nows begins
to decline into the mire of orthodoxy and excessive dogmatism?

Perhaps because religion is not about belief in God, but love of God. If
religion were never to decline, but rather reach a pinnacle from which
it never receded, then belief would be easy, and who would believe that
such belief was not synonymous with true love? The Faith declines that
it may be renewed, so that in each age there are reasons for people to
wonder Who God truly is, rather than merely accept what has come to be
regarded as unquestionably true.
