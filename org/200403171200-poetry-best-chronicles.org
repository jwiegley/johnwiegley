#+BEGIN_VERSE
Poetry best chronicles the devastation of the heart.

Whether lost love,
or mystical transcendence,
or abasing fear.

Whatever eradicates the man, and leaves the lover only:
alone, wondering, debating the validity of his feelings against
  a universe of other concerns.

Only when we truly feel the triviality of our experience,
does it somehow become genuine.
