#+BEGIN_VERSE
Hold up the wine cup
to the light, my friend.
See how it sparkles.
The light, like glinting diamonds,
reflects in the glass.
The ruby draught that waits to pour;
the blazing sapphire of your thirst:
all are treasures, found in one cup.

Now sprinkle the Camphor,
perfect, unblemished crystals.
Stir until they dissolve.
Let the wine digest them
and blend it all into One.

Now take hold this cup
that holds the wine
that holds the bright, coruscant lights,
that holds the hope of your thirst's desire --
and drink deep.
