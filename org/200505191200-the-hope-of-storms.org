#+title: The hope of storms

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I have heard the sea
pour out its mournful lament;
and the dirge of the clouds
with their rumbles and lightnings.

I have watched the grey sky
enfold us in a shroud of sorrow;
as the pall-bearer drops
loose their lugubrious weight.

These storms that feel
like unending death:
yet they kiss the ground
with bright green hope.
