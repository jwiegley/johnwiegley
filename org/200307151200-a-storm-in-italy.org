#+title: A storm in Italy

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Tonight there is a storm in Italy,
angry in white shouts across the sky;
its massive brow furrowing in cumulus piles
grey upon black,
throwing down water on the heads,
leering, towering,
a heavy fist that shakes in fury,
wringing drops of its own, pallid blood
on the earth below.
