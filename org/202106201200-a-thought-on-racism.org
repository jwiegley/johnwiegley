title: A thought on racism
tags: journal

A thought I had this week: We have two deep problems regarding racism in
this country: A policy problem, and a love problem. Anti-racism is an
effective stance with regard to policy, but it does not move the needle
very far on the matter of love: Not just including, but cherishing; not
just accepting, but befriending; not just supporting, but sacrificing
for love's sake. It's this heart-distance that has allowed the policy
problem to sink such deep roots.
