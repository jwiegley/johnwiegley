#+BEGIN_VERSE
Looking at the self,
which at first appears to be
a constant entity moving through time,
you discover it's more like
a standing wave form.

There is no "self" that persists.

You are actualized by the water,
ever flowing through.

What is there to "be" enlightened?
Nor does the Ocean ever cease
its surge and flow.
