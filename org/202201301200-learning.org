#+title: Learning

If we experience failure from the perspective of a humble posture of
learning, then failure makes the mind ready for what it needs to learn.
Otherwise, it can become a barrier, a discouragement. It's like tilling
the soil: Until the ground is broken up, the seed may not take.
Sometimes we have to discover what our weaknesses are in order to learn
where strength must be shored up.
