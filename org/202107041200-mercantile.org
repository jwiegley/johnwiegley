#+BEGIN_VERSE
Prayer magnetizes the needle of the heart;
and since He is closer to us
than our life's vein,
no movement is needed,
merely direction
and sanctity of heart.

I think the length of our prayer
should relate to our need for
this refining and alignment.

I don't think God desires
a mercantile relationship with us,
where count and length
are measures of spiritual value.
