title: The soul and perfection
tags: journal

The soul can love only perfection. But first it must learn how to
recognize perfection. When it begins seeing it in life, it falls in love
with that essential Quality. And what it has fallen in love with, loves
the soul in return: Faith dawns that these two may become reunited. That
faith is empowered by choice, with education providing the moral guide
to the choices that will lead toward, and the choices that will lead
away. That good choices draw us near is guaranteed, as with the opposite
-- and so justice is born. As the process continues, the soul comes
alive, and opens its eyes -- to see with His. The purpose of life is to
test souls to awaken, so that after death they may take their place, as
tokens of divine beauty and grace.
