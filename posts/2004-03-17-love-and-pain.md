    I have taken Pain into my arms  
    for a final kiss --  
    no longer shall it sting me.

    But then I wait;  
    my lips grow dry --  
    until the anguish of no anguish  
    overcomes me,  
    and my arms fly open once again.

    It is a pain so sweet  
    we remember every bitter word!  
    Burned into our memory  
    with a flame of love --  
    ambivalent, yet fierce in meaning.

    It is I, the pale shadow,  
    who feels burnt by the sun;  
    not I, the blazing glory,  
    whose rays reach to infinity.
