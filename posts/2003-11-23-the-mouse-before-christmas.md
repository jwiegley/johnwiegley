| 'Twas the season for sneezing
| and all through the house
| not a creature was quiet --
| not even the mouse.
|
| With tiny-sized sniffles
| and paws he should clean,
| a sick little mousekin
| completed the scene:
|
| A family of ill ones
| all tucked in their beds,
| sipping coughsyrup cocktails
| to lighten their heads,
|
| But the poor baby mouse
| had nothing to take:
| his chest was all stuffed,
| his nose and eyes ached.
|
| So under the floorboards
| he crawled here and there,
| searching for aspirin
| or things he could share;
|
| Maybe a tissue,
| a coughdrop to lick...
| anything people might
| take when they're sick.
|
| "If it works for others,
| then maybe for me!
| I'd try anything now,
| even Vitamin C!"
|
| He searched and he hunted
| this way and that
| his aching head tired,
| his hair full of mats,
|
| Till at last he sighed
| and gave up his quest,
| tucking his tail
| for a brief moment's rest.
|
| When who should appear
| but a girl and her sniffles;
| carrying handfuls of Kleenex
| all wadded in fistfuls;
|
| She noticed the mouse
| and begin to shout!
| but the sight of his plight
| kept the cry from her mouth.
|
| They startled each other
| and stared eye to eye:
| the mouse in his corner
| the girl on her side;
|
| "Oh dear little mouse,
| what's happened to you?
| It looks to my eyes
| like you're sick with the flu!"
|
| His eyes were too runny
| to blink in response,
| so he wiggled his whiskers
| and twitched his tail once.
|
| She patted his head
| and said, "My dear, it's alright!"
| You can cozy with me
| for the rest of the night!
|
| So they slept in her bed
| that girl and her mouse,
| and no one else stirred
| all through the house.
