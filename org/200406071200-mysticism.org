[WARNING] Note with key '1' defined at line 59 column 1 but not used.
All knowledge furthers the development of vision. If one study
structural engineering and look at a bridge, he will see what others
cannot see. As a computer programmer, I look at lines of code and see
purpose; physicists visualize whole universes in a few pages of
mathematics.

In these terms, I think mysticism is the systematic development of one's
vision of the whole. Rather than enriching detail, it steps outside of
the very eyes that see, giving one a glimpse of things from an
ever-greater viewpoint.

For example, we see many of the events that make up our lives. We can
learn about the content of those events, how they take place, etc. But
we rarely see how they fit together. There have been movies --
/Shortcuts/, /Playing by Heart/, /Magnolia/ -- that play on this theme,
showing how several lives can interact with each other. Yet none of us
see the whole mosaic. As Rumi tells it, we're all feeling a single
elephant in the dark, but each one of us is feeling a different part.

To see what is not there -- is how one poet described faith. Is there a
grand design that sheds meaning on all the chaotic happenings of life?
Since no eye can ever view all the data -- and it renews itself with
every moment -- we can never answer this question. Thus it takes a
certain gift of absurdity to credit the idea that there is purpose where
none is evident. Such absurdity is as wine for the mystic's cup...

We begin with the assertion that everything has meaning, like a sea in
which we swim. The question is, can one learn to /see/ the water, even
though we've lived it in for so long? Can one self-administer the "red
pill"? The holy books say that the Grand Design aims at the upliftment
of mankind: that every atom is ordained for the training of the soul. If
so, then the value of events is very different from how I was taught to
see things. In anger, there might be love; in war, peace. "No defect
canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze:
Seest thou a single flaw?" (Qur'Ã¡n)

It is always easy to disregard what the mystic seeks, however, because
it is never rational. Whatever proof we offer presuppose the very system
of reasoning it seeks to prove. That just won't do. Our only
justification is in changing the quality of life. After all, what is
real? Is the way we see things real, or how it affects us that we care
about? Is happiness made of atoms, or how we relate to those atoms? If a
sunset grows insipid to one person, but always amazing to other: which
sees "the real"?

I knew not what amazement was
Until I made Thy love my cause.
O how amazing would it be
If I were not amazed by Thee![^1]

I think every school of thought defines its own normality, in all of
which the mystic seems absurd; so too with the mystic, for whom all
normality is thus. Mysticism is that vision which ever scorns itself for
lack of vision: that keeps whole worlds in store, just when we think
we've found its end. So if you, too, find yourself looking at the
contents of your life -- and then the next day as if you'd never seen
them before -- you might be one of us.
