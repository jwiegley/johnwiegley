An analogy I've been giving some thought to lately is that of cells in a human
body. I think they have something to say about the meaning of selflessness,
and how to balance the needs of the individual against that of the whole.

From the beginning, cells are differentiated by function: liver cells, lung
cells, heart cells, etc. Each has a role to play, although roles may differ
greatly. However, all cells have a significance to the whole. A healthy
organism does not part with its living cells if it can avoid it. If someone
came at me with a scalpel, there's really no part I'd want to give away!

Further, although individual cells have their own notion of health and
prosperity, this health is meaningless if the entire organism becomes sick or
depressed. The health of the body is the health of its cells, but the health
of any cell is also, directly or indirectly, dependent on the health of the
body. There is a correspondence between the micro and macro, like a single
image reflected in countless mirrors.

This notion of identity held by the person, even though he is physically a
moving forms of cells, transcends any grouping of those cells. If you take
away arms, ears, or feet, a person would still claim that "I" persists. This
"I" is not dependent on the cells, even though it is expressed through and
affected by them. In this way, the self of the cell is meaningless on its own;
its being lies in how it supports the higher self.

Thus the value of a cell lies entirely in how it serves the whole. Even if
some cells play a crucial role at times, brain cells, heart cells, every cell
is valued for its function, not the mere fact of its individuality. There is
no cell we prize in the body over others simply for its uniqueness. Each
cell's distinction lies in service to a being greater than itself.

This is a subtle point between intrinsic and extrinsic value. A single rose
has great value in that its existence gives us access to roseness for a while;
without it and others, roseness would be inaccessible. So too, individuals
manifest the attributes of God in the world; as Christ said, "Ye are the salt
of the earth; but if the salt has lost his savour, wherewith shall it be
salted?"

When we play this role, that of manifesting or serving a higher reality, it
fulfills our being and grants us extreme value. But this is not an intrinsic
merit; it is contingent on our relationship to that greater being. This is
what I mean by saying that a cell's value consists in its function, not its
independent reality apart from the body.

When the cell finds its happiness in what it can do to render this service,
and measures happiness by the well-being of the whole, I think it has attained
to selflessness; not by denying itself, but by shifting its locus of awareness
to a higher plane. On that plane, all cells are equal, because their purpose,
their joy, their ultimate goal, is equal. In the physical plane they differ by
function, but on this higher plane, of the being they support, they differ not
at all. I think of this when reading the following statement by Bahá'u'lláh:

> "Manifold and mysterious is My relationship with God. I am He, Himself, and
> He is I, Myself, except that I am that I am, and He is that He is." So too,
> I am my cells, and my cells are I, though we each have our own being, in our
> own sphere.
