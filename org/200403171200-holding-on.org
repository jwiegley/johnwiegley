#+title: Holding on

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Sadness sits down with me for tea,
and my cup fills up with tears.

Emptiness grips me,
and the content is gone.

Loneliness holds me,
and I cease to care.

Depression finds me,
and it all fades to uniform black...

But somewhere, there is a spark.
Otherwise I'd be already gone.
