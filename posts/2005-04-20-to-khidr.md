    O Khidr!
    My tricky friend
      and true,
    my green Satan,
    my soul-destroyer...

    You've pounded my heart
    into a tasty morsel,
    thrust me onto a skewer,
    and roasted me like kabob.

    I never knew I could be so delicious.

    The friends of God do not understand
      my love for you.
    They think me mad, of no account;
    they imagine my joy is from
      lack of understanding.

    I tell your tales and do my part,
    but even if they hear me
    they don't listen.

    As for me, I choose that
      wild and reckless dance!
    headlong into the fire.

    Turn me over the coals --
      again, and yet again --
    that I may wear this
      blackened char of self
      as my crown of glory.
