#+BEGIN_VERSE
Dear reader!

You are the unsought treasure.
The jewel mistaken for glass.
The sleeping queen taken for a peasant.

Awaken your true self!
You are the gateway, the hidden door,
the catalyst for what might be.

A painting in a lightless cave
  is equal to the pressing void.
You were made to catch the light;
to reveal its beauty secrets.

Your nature is never far from Him.
Only: the unlit candle
  knows nothing at first
of Heat and Flame.
