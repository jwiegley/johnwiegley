#+title: Those eyes

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Young Leyla,
with bright eyes
like stars from another heaven.
You guide this lonely mariner,
his ship twice-wrecked
against life's tormented seas.
For now I have
new hopes to lift me:
that elsewhere in love's firmament
there might be other eyes
like these.
#+END_VERSE
