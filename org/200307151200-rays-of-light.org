#+BEGIN_VERSE
The Rays of light from that Sun
are as Swords that slay the darkness --
a single shaft of which passes unopposed
through all the eternity of space.

As it strikes the pure in heart, the chaste, the free,
it rebounds in the direction of their regard,
to reach the dark places, the hidden caves --
every cavern and gorge of the earth's benighted depths.

And if it chance upon a crystal
lying concealed in centuries of night,
it will burst into a glowing warmth:
a flower of light amid a garden of rocks and stone;

Until the lights of the Divine Unity
shine even from the sightless heart of the Earth.
