A friend and I sat down today to make a mystical exercise out of writing
arrogant poetry. This kind of poetry is when you center your focus on a
particular virtue until you feel yourself invested with a sense of its
power. Then you write a poem from that point of view, allowing the
feelings of grandeur to flow through you. For example, you might
meditate on "majesty", imagine yourself to be a king, and write poems
expressing the heady might of a king's dominion.

Here are the poems that come from our exchange, in which we both wrote
two poems followed by two more as an answer to each other's two:

[[file:the.master]]

[[file:the.moth.king]]

[[file:all.bow]]

[[file:secrets.of.fire]]
