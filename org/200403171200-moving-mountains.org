#+title: Moving mountains

#+BEGIN_VERSE
One drop of water holds a grain;
one moment of time, a thought.

No one noticed the little thieves
who stole what nature'd wrought.

Now a broad canyon sleeps
where a mountain once was king --

Perhaps one of the believers gestured.

  “If you have faith
  even as a grain of mustard seed
  you will say to this mountain
  `Remove thee from!'
  and it will move.” -- Matthew 17:20
