#+title: The space between souls

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A flower reaches to the sun:
it never touches, but achieves.

The wind listens as we listen back;
the sea understands, the stars speak.

  Take away arms, I love you;
  take away legs, I love you;
  take away eyes, I love you;
  no more body,
  no more name,
  no more "you":
  I love you.

You stand before my eyes
ten thousand feet away
and all I see
is that lover inside me.

How can we be separate from ourselves?
Run! Escape the perfection of God!
As I watch, to behold the impossible.
