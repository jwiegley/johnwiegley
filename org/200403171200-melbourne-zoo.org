#+BEGIN_VERSE
Giraffe: tall, long-headed -- a tongue of 40cm
Sloping back, checkered spots;
he slips away to nibble on some palm leaves.

Kangaroo hopping up, biting the finger of a youngster
whose Mom finds it amusing!
A beautiful coat of orange-brown,
very interested in people.

Wombat: squat, fat, slow. Burrowing.
A burrowed mound for a home.
Not moving an inch: a lazy gopher the size of a watermelon.
