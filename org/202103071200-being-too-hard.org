#+BEGIN_VERSE
Being too hard on yourself
  is ego too:
measuring yourself harshly
against a standard derived
from your own understanding.

The path forward
is a free and humble heart,
continuously learning
and turning toward God and joy.

"Ego" arises from ideas
that ossify into a false sense of reality ---
whether within or without ---
and become veils between us
and the Loved One.
