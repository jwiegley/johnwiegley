#+title: Passing me by

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I repose with sadness
beneath a canopy of memories;
and watch my life -- how it unfolded --
wondering exactly who lived it?

Not all the sentiments were mine;
not all the thoughts would I agree with.
As if a ghost had given me his memories,
and left me to contemplate them for a while.

What frightens me is that this ghost
intends to continue using my body.
But I shall not let it! I shall awake!
The life of unawareness is too small for us both.
