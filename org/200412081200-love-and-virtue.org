title: Love and virtue

I think love is really the mother of all virtue. Take patience, for
example. If I really love someone, I am happy to wait. My happiness and
joy at doing so means I do not perceive the waiting as patience --
though everyone around me might. The idea that virtue is proven by its
being "hard" or by "suffering" places the emphasis on me; whereas virtue
that proceeds from love, and thus leads to gladness, places all emphasis
on the Beloved.

If we truly saw our Best-Beloved in all things, would not virtue be the
natural expression of our innermost desires? Forgiveness, sacrifice,
patience, kindliness, service -- these are as breathing to a lover.
