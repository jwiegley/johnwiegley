There are two different kinds of recognition: surface recognition, or
acknowledgement; and true recognition, where one understands the
fullness of a thing and its implications -- not merely its shape or
name.

For example, if the President of the United States were to enter a
kindergarten class, I'm sure most of the students would "recognize" him.
They could give his name, title, and where they'd seen him last. But if
the same President entered a classroom of graduate students in political
science, the difference in degree of ther recognition is due to years of
study and experience in the field he represents.

Similarly, when the Bahá´í Writings speak of recognizing the
Manifestation of God, I think it is much more than acknowledging His
name, or naming His station. True recognition is something that can only
occur after having been immersed in the Truth He represents. There are
