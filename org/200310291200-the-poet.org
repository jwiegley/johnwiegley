#+title: The poet

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A poet never knows which way
  his pen will go, his mind will go;
the canvas of the soul
heeds his worded strokes --
but the image remains unseen.

Just as we speak from feeling,
making full sentences
  not knowing them beforehand,

there is a vastness, unfilled,
begging for that single drop...
whose echoes
are the shape of my words on paper.
