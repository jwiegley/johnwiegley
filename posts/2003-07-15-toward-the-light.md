    Flowers break open like little hands
    with gifts of blue and gold,
    holding them up for the sun to glance,
    not thinking the act too bold...

    Once a seed, it began in the dirt
    and the dark -- and fought to rise,
    breaking through when to move was deterred,
    a glimpse of sun for its prize.

    Soaking in rays, and climbing higher,
    it followed its will to grow;
    and raised its head it verdant desire,
    nor wanting to look below.

    Within it knew it could still be more --
    a child of the Shining Sun --
    and looked down deep, to its meager core,
    for a way to get it done.

    It found that nature had hid inside
    the means to it all along:
    asking only the seed to provide
    the will to want to belong

    To a world of beauty, fill with light,
    where the act of seeing is joy;
    and all eyes are endowed with sight --
    if the owner makes that choice.

    Any wonder, then, that such a world
    honors beauty by the same?
    The highest worship, the choicest pearl:
    That a work of God's should earn the name.
