    There are no poems in me today.  
    The weary world is calling, "sleep,"  
    and I, having followed the lure,  
    found only a siren too tired to keep me.

    There are no poems in me afterward.  
    When after wondering what this feeling this,  
    I never quite complete the thought,  
    and lose the sense of why it was  
    I ever felt it in the first place.

    There were no poems in me then.  
    Because what I wrote was hardly more than words.  
    When you try too hard to force meaning from desire,  
    a certain poverty overcomes you,  
    which you promise to recover some future day  
    only to marvel at how distant the "future" stays.

    Finally, I haven't a poem for you today.  
    Only these words that search always,  
    and remind me to think,  
    and keep me safe,  
    when the arms of the weary world surround me.
