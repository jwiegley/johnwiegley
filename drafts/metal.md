# Stories in Metal

## The Crucible of Tests

Just as ice, hard and inflexible, warms into water that flows everywhere,
steel also undergoes a phase change at high temperatures that allows it to be
hammered into any shape. Below that temperature, one could hammer all day and
make little difference; so we say, "strike while the iron is hot", because
this is when change is most possible, whereas afterward little change can
happen.

And like a furnace, this existence is hot, painful and often damaging. We live
in a crucible where impurities are discovered, hearts are softened, and we are
offered the flexibility to decide in what shape we present ourselves to God.

While the metal is being forged, it is constantly being tested for strength,
form, and purpose. This is part of the value in tests and difficulties,
because during these moments you are pounded and weighed and measured. But
once the forging is done and the steel is quenched, there is no longer any
testing or hammering: the time has come for final polishing and putting it to
use! As `Abdu'l-Bahá says, "... the tests and trials of God take place in this
world, not in the world of the Kingdom."

## The Wielder's Choice

And after the time of heat and trial is done, the blade is brought to the
field. As a knife or a sword, whatever it's size and shape, it has a special
purpose from the result of its fashioning.

How one judges the fitness of the instrument varies. To the smith, who moves
in the world of sharp tools, there are clear definitions of right and good.
The blade should be neat, free of impurities, straight, sharp and
well-balanced. One can even measure each blade against the rest to determine
who is more and less capable, who has beauty and who has frailty.

But to the solder in the field, this scale does not necessarily apply. The
best sword is the one that fits his style, the way he moves, the shape of his
hand. Perhaps a blade that objectively is the worst could offer the most
comfortable fit *for his physique*, so that a unique pairing of sword and
swordsman develops. Then, even if a finer tool is offered, he will stay the
one that he knows and has learned to dance with.

|
| As judged by
| and compared with

|
| What matters most
| are the qualities
| *that the Chef alone*
| adores in that knife.

Likewise, our goal in this fiery existence is to make ourselves attractive to
the Holy Spirit, so that it may move through us as It wills, empowering our
actions, and creating tidal waves of transformation that might begin as mere
ripples. Although we see ourselves and our own development, and may criticize
how we are not this or not quite that, our salvation lies in becoming that
very instrument who is most welcome to the Master's Hand; for it is by *His*
qualities and nature that this is decided, and not our own standards of
perfection, according to what the other blades know.
