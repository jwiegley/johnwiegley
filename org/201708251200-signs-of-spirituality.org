#+title: Signs of a spiritual person

Look at how they treat others. Do they complain about life, or
appreciate what they have? Do they have time for you when you need it?
What is most important to them? How do they react to things happening in
the world? How do they respond to the boring, ordinary moments that life
is full of, not just when things are exciting and eventful? If you look
closely, you may find spirituality in places you'd never expect to.
