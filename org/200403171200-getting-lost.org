#+BEGIN_VERSE
We are all butterflies,
heading on our way to somewhere wonderful.

Then one foot gets stuck in the web.
And rather than peeling it off
and continuing on our way,
we feel compelled to look further --
when there's nothing further to see!

So it happens that each step
entangles us deeper and deeper.
Soon we'll never fly again.

Then the spider comes
and our blood is sucked dry.
We are nothing left
but a dry carcass, troubled by the wind.
