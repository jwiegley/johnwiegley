    My heart has bent itself into the shape of a crescent moon,  
    leaning gently: the unconcerned shape of a smile.

    I laze in the full deep of night,  
    sprawling like a cat who remembers kittenhood;

    Softly the dreams whisper in,  
    and the maiden-form of sleep surrounds me.

    My body is an easy target, stretched out full,  
    baring to the night-world my secrets of manhood.

    I see the colors of you and me,  
    and hear the laughter of unremembered thoughts;

    I feel textures that speak of love and dearness,  
    and dialog with a concourse of shifting images.

    Their words are as the light of the sun,  
    and they speak with the wisdom of a child's laughter, winsome:

    I don't recall the message, or the meaning, only --  
    I feel it in the afterglow of waking, like body-knowledge:

    The distance between you and me is a dream.
