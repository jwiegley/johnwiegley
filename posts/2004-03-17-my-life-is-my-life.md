    They wonder why I need to be free from the world,  
    but their wonder is their wonder  
    and my life is my life.

    Any attempt to break free is labelled "heresy",  
    as they struggle to hold me down --  
    for my life is my life.

    I don't expect "let me be" to go over with anyone  
    but at least leave me to decide my own dreams.  
    My life is my life, and despite it all  
    I intend to live it.
