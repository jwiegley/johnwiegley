| Without consent, my heart accepted your religion,
| at whose temple it sings canticles of praise;
|
| I send these verses with much affection;
| I write for you these humble bouquets.
|
| The sight of your body has consumed me in fire,
| and your eyes doused me by their limpid pools;
|
| Fear not, if madness is apparent in these lines:
| all love's poetry is the province of fools.
|
| I yearn for worship, this is why I write --
| perhaps words can mollify love's fire;
|
| These greetings are from the battlefield of love;
| forgive me if it seems too much, too dire.
|
| Your lips, your neck... your face like the moon,
| and eyes that bear the radiance of dawn!
|
| In the places where games of love are played,
| your body is a queen that fells this pawn.
|
| Through all the walks and pain of life,
| souls long for what they cannot feel;
|
| Then one day, in this world's unreality,
| I beheld in you the figure of the Real.
|
|   My Beloved is the Message, full of Light;
|   and your beauty, its bearer, noon-day bright.
|
| The stomach informs the hungry of his goal;
| and thirst gives understanding of the lake;
|
| Your grace, your figure, your lovely form --
| are answer to the questions manhood makes.
