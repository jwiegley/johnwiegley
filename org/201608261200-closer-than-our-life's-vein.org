title: Closer than our life's vein

God is nearer to us than our life's vein, and we are always "but one
step away from the glorious heights above, and the celestial Tree of
Love." I don't think the Abhá Kingdom is a place we are debarred from
until we are worthy, because we are never worthy. "Should God punish men
for their perverse doings, He would not leave on earth a moving thing."

The real paradise for human souls lies in recognition of the
Manifestation of God. I mean, really, truly knowing who He is, and what
He represents. If we knew this, we would cry for joy until expiring from
this life. This is the Abhá Kingdom, and to reach it requires changing
our vision, our perception, the very fabric of who we think we are.

This sort of sea change cannot come about through study or reflection;
not even by action alone. It must be accompanied by sacrifice, pain, and
constant testing. We are all iron ingots, being pounded into shining
blades of steel. There is no moment's rest, no greater joy than to be
fashioned into our perfect state, hammer blow by hammer blow.

If this does not accord with our current definition of happiness, then
our concept of happiness must be changed for something greater. A seed
is quite happy far under the ground, but this is not fitting for a tree;
the infant must endure being born if he is to live, no matter how happy
a place the womb world might be.

Is this process hard, difficult, arduous? Of course it is. And the
reward is equally wondrous, delightful, and amazing. If we only knew!
