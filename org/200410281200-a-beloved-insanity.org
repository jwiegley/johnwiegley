#+title: A beloved insanity

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Love is a beloved insanity.
If tongues could speak the tale
of love's madness,
no hearers would remain.

They would, as one breath,
ascend ash-like upon the breeze
offering their hearts to the pyre --
and not a one complain.

For when it touched my own lips,
it ruined my heart's kingdom.
Peace became a travesty:
my very hope was my despair.

Where banners once flew in proud disdain
a king now weeps for his kingdom's bane.
