    Tenderly, with your arms around me
      your lips close to my ear
      your head against my shoulder
      your hair on my cheek
      your warmth, surrounding me
      your still, calming air
      your eyes, mostly closed
      your form next to mine
      your breathing, soft and deep
      your quiet silence
      your gentle, stirring touch...

    You are everything I dream of
    and nothing I can know --
    without you here, beside me,
    holding me just so...
