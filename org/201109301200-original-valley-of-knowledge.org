#+title: Original valley of knowledge

/The Conference of the Birds/ is a story of thirty birds who are all
seeking to reach the immortal King. Their guide, the Hoopoe bird,
describes to them seven valleys which all must pass through before they
can achieve their final destination. It is these seven valleys which
Bahá'u'lláh elaborates in His text "The Seven Valleys".

The word for "valley" in these texts does not mean a lush ravine between
mountains. "vádí" refers to what people in the Southwestern US would
know as an arroyo: it is a dry river, useful as a guide when making
one's way through a desert.

The following quotes come from two different translations of the
Conference of the Birds; all of them are from that book's Valley of
Knowledge (which is also translated as Valley of Understanding, and
Valley of Mystic Insight).

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
When the mystery of the essence of beings reveals itself clearly to [the
wayfarer] the furnace of this world becomes a garden of flowers. He who
is striving will be able to see the almond in its hard shell. He will no
longer be pre-occupied with himself, but will look up at the face of his
Friend. In each atom he will see the whole; he will ponder over
thousands of bright secrets...

Real knowledge becomes the possession of the true seeker. If it is
necessary to seek knowledge in China, then go. But knowledge is
distorted by the formal mind, it becomes petrified, like stones. How
long must real knowledge continue to be misunderstood? This world, this
house of sorrows, is in darkness; but true knowledge is a jewel, it will
burn like a lamp and guide you in this gloomy place. If you spurn this
jewel you will ever be a prey to regret. If you lag behind you will weep
bitter tears. But if you sleep little by night, and fast by day, you may
find what you seek. Seek, then, and be lost in the quest.

Of those who dwell in this Valley it is said:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
He will perceive the marrow, not the skin --
the self will disappear; then, from within
the heart of all he sees, there will ascend
the longed-for face of the immortal Friend.

A hundred thousand secrets will be known
when that unveiled, surpassing Face is shown --
a hundred thousand men must faint and fail
till one shall draw aside the secret's veil.

Perfected, of rare courage, he must be
to dive through that immense, uncharted sea.
If you discern such hidden truths and feel
joy flood your life, do not relax your zeal!

Though thirst is quenched,
  though you are bathed in bliss
beyond all hypothesis,
though you should reach the throne of God,
  implore Him still unceasingly:

  "Is there yet anymore?"
