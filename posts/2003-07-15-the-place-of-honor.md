    If a painting by Rafael,  
    in a museum of lesser pieces,  
    found itself hidden in a far corner  
    would it be wrong if it cleared its throat  
    and in the name of honoring its Maker  
    requested a place at the highest point  
    beneath the brightest lights --  
    if it requested that artworks be ranked  
    according to their quality  
    and not some random or arbitrary arrangement?

    Then why do men forget the Hand that made them?  
    and shy away from the high places  
    and the light and the admiration  
    which it is theirs alone to earn,  
    theirs alone to merit by superlative virtue?

    Each thing reflects a degree of light  
    from the Infinite Source,  
    achieving color and luminosity in measure  
    to its attributes and capacity.  
    But if one these reveal  
    the very image of the source itself --  
    "I have created man in My own likeness" --  
    how can he hide from this revelation,  
    or dissemble his tie to greatness?

    If a mirror is created to reflect,  
    and the most stunning of beauties stand before it,  
    how can it look upon itself as ugly?  
    or fail to rejoice  
    at bearing such a vision of glory?
