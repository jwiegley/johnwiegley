    Two men prayed to God:
    One said only one word
    and was given a life of bounty in response.
    The other prayed for decades...
    but received only a drop.
    
    Of these two,
    I think the latter was much more fortunate.
    
    Because,one day, these two will approach God.
    To the first, He will ask:
    "I gave you a life-time of bounty; why just one word?"
    To the other He will say:
    "For only a drop, you pledged your life."
    
    If this life gives you suffering
      in answer for your prayers:
    perhaps He answers another prayer,
    to be asked by a future self.
