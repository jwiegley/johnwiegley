    Spring has come  
    stealing dew from the leaves  
    to make flowers:  
    a fecund dance  
    of seed and soil and sun.

    The pregnant Earth,  
    the watering sky;  
    all the land giving birth:  
    a hoarde of children  
    who scream with their colors...

    The bees are dressed in banded aprons,  
    gathering what can be gathered,  
    making their honeyed draught.  
    Love is in the air, this season.  
    What will you make of it?
