    Waiting for the tips of trees  
    to bow at your arrival...  
    waiting.

    Waiting for the sun's light  
    to reflect your longing gaze...  
    waiting.

    Waiting for the phone to ring --  
    a letter, a foot-fall...  
    waiting.

    Waiting in a depth of silence  
    that drowns my expectations...  
    waiting.

    Waiting for the moon to shine,  
    but not so bright  
    as that face near mine...  
    waiting.

    Waiting for you, if you haven't understood --  
    waiting for you.
