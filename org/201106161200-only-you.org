#+BEGIN_VERSE
There are times when I come to You in prayer,
and feel like a beggar, hoping for salvation.
Other days, I am a merchant, bargaining for my soul.

I have been a philosopher, musing on death;
and a coward, praying for more life.

Each time I bow my head,
I wear a different costume,
and a different name to my profession.

But today, I long to feel none of these.
I wish only to come to You in prayer,
and find no one else in attendance.
