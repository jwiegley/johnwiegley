#+title: Podcasting experiment

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Podcasting][Podcasting]] is a means for
broadcasting audio content through a medium such as a weblog. Some
people "podcast" news programs, interviews, poetry, or even just their
weblog entries.

As an experiment, I will be podcasting the next few entries. What this
means is that the title for each entry is a link to an MP3 of myself
reading that entry. For those using RSS syndicators, the XML will
provide enclosure info for downloading the audio file. If you use a
reader like iPodder, or NetNewsWire, it will be very easy to download
the file to an MP3 player, and listen to it there instead of reading it
on the Web.

Please send feedback if you actually listen and want podcasting to
continue! The first podcast entry is the one above: the poem
"Foolishness".
