It seems so awfully strange, that we should be bound to agree with the
religious sentiments of our current era.  As I look around, I realize
that the Faith will look so different from the way it does now -- when
its membership will include all sorts of people, from every walk of
life.  Are the attitudes today the same as they were in the 1920s?  Our
sense of "propriety", of "reverence", of "appropriateness": these are
more social conventions that came with our mother's milk!  If there is a
Law governing a certain detail of human life, that's different; but
where there is no law, we have complete freedom of action.  That is the
nature of our free-will.  I would say that 5% of being a Bahá'í lies in
dealing with the Law.  This would mean that the other 95% is the
relationship we form from our own sense of His Divine Reality.  It
shouldn't be dictated to us by others, no matter how subtlely or kindly.
Of the three things necessary to comprehend His Teachings, Bahá'u'lláh
lists among them "freedom of spirit".  Outside the dictates of the Law,
our spirits have been given the prerogative to soar, and soar, and soar;
anything that would bind us is a chain from this world.
