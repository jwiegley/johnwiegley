#+title: My butterfly self

#+BEGIN_VERSE
My relation to my self
is as a caterpillar
to the butterfly
who dwells within.

The Writings of God
talk of the real world:
stories in the language
of those who fly;
depicting a doorway
in the shape of a chrysalis
that I might know
what form to adopt
to be born again....

Into a world
of flight and freedom!
limbs dancing in the light
all the beautiful colors
shining through paper wings
subtle, touched by God,
gentle on the breeze
and with vision over all things.

Yet this story of joy and promise --
a heaven to those who fly --
is yet a tale of sorrow
to the caterpillar
so long as he wishes
to remain as he is
and not be free.
