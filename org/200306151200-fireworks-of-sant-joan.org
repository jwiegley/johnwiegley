#+BEGIN_VERSE
At one moment, it is too quiet.
Expectation remakes the stillness
into a sharp knife
cutting away at the future...

Then a tiny puff of sound,
the tension climbing in pace
with some unseen shape
that waiting eyes see too well...

Then too fierce for the one moment!
whose gentle, pausing silence
is ripped into a flash of color
as a wound from some bright being
hiding in the blackened clouds
until...
that one moment of sound and flash.

And now the embers of a heavenly fire
drift slowly back to earth.
