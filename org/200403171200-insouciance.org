#+BEGIN_VERSE
there are soft breezes blowing
a tree the color of wheat
a sun over all

restless, the wind teasing the grass tips

there are no clouds to watch
only a day so gentle
it seems like a lullabye

where are the seas of time?
the twin shores of Then and When?
i've landed on this sandbar amidst the vast blue
of time and sky...
even my pen is ready to unwind
