One of the things religion aims to teach people is how to appreciate God's
creation.  In the Seven Valleys, Bahá'u'lláh says the purpose is "...that
every man may thereby win his way to the summit of realities, until none shall
contemplate anything whatsoever but that he shall see God therein."

Since God is the best of all things: the most beautiful, most wondrous, most
inspiring Reality one could imagine, then seeing him everywhere means becoming
excited by life like a little child.  Everything has some new meaning, some
secret to be unwrapped.

This is the Kingdom of God.  It is paradise, heaven, the apex of consciousness
and understanding.  And He created it for us, His children.  He sent all His
Messengers with their Glad-Tidings to summon us to that pure and perfect
world.

Nor is it someplace near or far.  It is all around us, within us.  If we see
God in people, we can love everyone; if we see Him in the things of the world,
we will fall in love with life; if we see Him in ourselves -- "behold Me
standing within thee, Mighty, Powerful and Self-Subsisting" -- we realize we
are never, ever alone.

Christ said, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to
give you the Kingdom."  This is the life we were created to know.  It is what
our souls have longed for since the moment of conception.  And the Path to
that Reality can be found through the way of the Manifestations of God, in
Their Writings and Their example.
