In the limited realm of Násút, we see the Manifestations by Their
humanity, and observe and weigh them using standards we might apply to
other human beings. At best in this realm They are seen as wonderful
souls and peerless hearts, Who sacrifice Themselves for the benefit of
humanity. Their Divine origin is taken as an article of faith, whose
evidence remains indirect. They are also seen as quite different from
each Other, in terms of language, teachings, social customs, etc.

In the realm of Malakút, the place of eternal appearances, we see Them
by Their divine qualities, and realize that just as two perfect roses
may be understood as the same rose in terms of the everlasting Ideal
they realize, so too the Manifestations represent the same Purpose, the
same Mission and the same fundamental Reality. They are one Soul and one
Being, Who is continually resurrected to proclaim the same Message. This
is the realm where Their unity dissolves all distinctions, and it
becomes impossible to tell One apart from the Other, unless one make
reference to the humanity among whom They appeared.

In the realm of Jabarút, the place of the Unseen: if we are beings of
light and shadow, They are the Sun, eclipsing every other seeming
reality. Here the Primal Will is recognized to be the cynosure of all
hopes, and the ultimate goal of existence. Heaven is defined by faith in
Their Cause, and hell by the least separation. It does not matter even
if we lose our very selves in this path, because in finding Him, we have
found all.

It is my thinking lately that these three worlds (excepting Láhút, which
we cannot comprehend or experience) may map to the three stations of the
believer who experiences these worlds, given in the Seven Valleys:
limitation (tahdíd), unity (tawhíd) and annihilation of self leading to
eternal life in Him (faná va baqá).
