#+BEGIN_VERSE
How can I describe being together?
Every inch of you
reached miles into me.

Your hair
more than beautiful strands of black,
like a dark river where my fingers
wandered and strayed.

Your whole being
was a banquet of heart and mind
to fill my beating cup.

I walk away from your table
drunk every time --
flush until my heart is dizzy.

If children laugh at my staggering walk
let them know
how weak your memory makes me.

I am "ghani" now: rich like a king
whose eyes see only gold;

Or a fish, not contented with drops
who in your ocean feels no need.
