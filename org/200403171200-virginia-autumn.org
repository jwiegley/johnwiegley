#+BEGIN_VERSE
The wind... the wind...

I remember the scent of the wind:
catching up the leaves into whirls of
  red and brown,
gathering their varied fragrances of
  oak and pine, dogwood and cherry.

Their colors were like apricots,
mulberries or marmalade:
Scattered bits of potpourri flame,
floating along, swept by the wind...
