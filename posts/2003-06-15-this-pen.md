    How powerful,
    this pen in my hand;
    capable of reshaping the world.

    By itself,
    lonely and impotent.

    But if the will of an intent mind
    wields it with intention,
    its sharp point
    begins to shine into the future,
    like a laser pointing out
    the form of tomorrow.
