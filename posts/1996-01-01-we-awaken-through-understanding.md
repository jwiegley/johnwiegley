title: We awaken through understanding

We are so constituted that our nature is awakened through understanding.
True understanding causes a transformation down to the most basic level,
forcing us to open up as if there were some aperture between ourselves
and external reality.

The impulses and reactions that we have, such as the erotic complex and
such, exist and contend with each other out of innocence; for if there
were understanding, these would redirect themselves according to that
understanding.  This assumes a kind of plan, or certain functioning
described by the perfect human, which at the moment is shown a dim and
shadowy form compared to its potential culmination.
