#+BEGIN_VERSE
I was a fish
of the vasty deep.
Alone on beds
of coral and pearl
I used to take my sleep.

Until one day
I climbed up high
and filled my lungs with air --
now I cannot dive at all
except into despair.

I prayed to God,
“Assist my way!
I long to know Your depths --
if only for this bulb of air
this cursèd gasp of breath.”

How can nothing
keep me from Something?
This air inside me
  is not me
but binds me just as well.

So God answered
and poked me good
to save me from my hell.
