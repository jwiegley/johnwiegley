    A leaf falls into the river,
    swept away --
    entreaties are useless --
    the swift beat of time
    marked in nearing the sea.
    Turning and turning,
    jade green on the dark green below,
    and then nothing...

    Just the river, and the tree
    and my memory
    to count the loss.
