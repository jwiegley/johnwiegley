#+title: A place along sunset beach

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Where the ever-deepening silence
collects into quiet pools of sound,
and the waves of light
issuing from far-off beacons
touch my fingertips as I lift them to my face,

I understand that here is
a holy place,
where holy thoughts, and holy deeds,
have made sacred
a once ordinary ground.
