title: A journey of recognition

An infant learns pretty soon to recognize her mother, and who she is; but
only after that woman has grown, and has had children of her own and
watched them grow, can she recognize her mother for who and what she is.

In a similar way, I think the Seven Valleys is a journey of recognition.
The One we seek is not distant from us in time or space, but apprehension.
As He says:

> My creatures are even as the fish of the deep.  Their life
> dependeth upon the water, and yet they remain unaware of that which, by
> the grace of an omniscient and omnipotent Lord, sustaineth their very
> existence...[^1]

As we journey, we set about divesting ourselves of these gossamer veils:
of opinions, like walls that prison our mind in a particular view of
reality; of attachments, like hooks that draw the heart away from the
Goal; of heedlessness and lawlessness, which trap our very soul, though we
may fail to sense it.

For example, on the subject of unity I look at my own hand.  It has five
fingers, yet I regard the hand as a whole and definitely call the unit
"me".  Yet when the Manifestations say they are One and the same Being,
humanity balks.  We certainly comprehend the principle of manyness in
oneness; of the world of unity existing within the matrix of
differentiation.  We live and breath these concepts every day! -- in fact,
mental health depends on them.  But when applied to the Manifestations of
God, a fundamental disconnect occurs.

I think the Seven Valleys depicts a layer by layer unraveling of the
discordant elements which cause this disconnect: by withdrawing our
dependency on others as arbiters of truth; by reacquianting the heart with
its true love; by loosing the mind from a pinhole view of the world; by
looking beyond the shimmering image of the many until we see the unity of
the whole.
