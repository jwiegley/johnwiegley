title: Evident and manifest qualities

I've been thinking lately about the qualities we aspire to achieve
during our lives, and how these qualities seem to divide roughly into
two basic categories, the dividing line between which is the event of
death.

On the one hand are what I'll call "evident" qualities, or those which
are easily identified and as such most generally valued. They include
knowledge, wealth, strength, good health, freedom, wisdom, reknown,
achievement, infuence, etc. All of these have tremendous value before
death, but seem to have little after. For example, whatever we gain of
knowledge or wisdom in this life will seem like ignorance in the next,
in much the same way that an adult may regard his own thoughts from
childhood with a bit of embarassment and disdain.

The main point here is that the value of evident qualities is highly
dependent on context. Knowledge is only valuable if the context is one
of ignorance. When the "veils are lifted", what couldn't be seen before
will become clear as day, in which case our scraps of knowledge pale
into insignificance in the face of clear fact.

The other group of qualities I think of as "subtle" qualities, because
although they are mostly thought of as positive, they can be easily
overlooked by someone who does not value them -- perhaps even seen as a
weakness by some. These would include purity of heart, love, freedom of
spirit, recognition of one's powerlessness, humility, etc.
