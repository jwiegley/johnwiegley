Idealism and realism are different in concept from that between
optimisim and pessism, even though I sometimes here people say, "I'm not
pessimistic, I'm realistic", as if the ideas were similar.

Idealism and realism concern perceptions of reality.  An idealist will
see the world as he wants it to be, whereas a realist sees it as it is.
I think that idealism is great for vision, but terrible for planning and
implementation.  The same -- conversely -- with respect to realism.
Both of these traits are good, if they balance each other and are
applied at the right times.

Pessimism and optimism concern our expectation of outcomes.  That is,
any endeavor which reaches into the future touches on the unknown.  The
unknown is full of surprises, both bad and good.  The optimist will
prefer to anticipate a positive outcome.  If he is also a realist, he
will acknowledge the possibility of a bad outcome, but will focus on and
anticipate the positive one.  The idealist will ignore the bad outcomes
entirely, and fail to plan for them.

The pessimist on the other hand will prefer to anticipate a negative
outcome.  He simply assumes that most endeavors are bound to fail, or
will not achieve their highest fulfillment.  If he is an idealist, he
will never believe that good things can happen; if he is a realist, he
will accept this possibility, but still plan for the negative.

So when people say, "I'm not being pessimist, I'm being realistic", it
confuses the meaning of these two words, which apply to different
elements of perception.
