    In a single clap of thunder  
    I heard the angels hold concourse.  
    Speaking a myriad of tongues  
    they spoke meaning with a single syllable.

    In the aftermath of silence,  
    as the rains dissolved me into a dew,  
    I stepped beyond my puddle  
    to join the rays that dry the land...

    The lover carves himself into a feast,  
    to be dined on and reunited with his Friend.  
    His glory, then, is the ruddy glow  
    of his Beloved's fattened cheeks!

    Now I walk on gravel to soothe my feet,  
    and dry my hands in a running brook;  
    I look for warmth in the chill of dawn  
    and cool myself under a noon-day sun.

    My peace is the heart of cities: honking, ringing, smoking.  
    Everywhere I look, the crowds are still.  
    Not a sound beneath all the vaults of heaven.  
    In this silence of prayer, all voices speak to me, screaming.

    I find the living under the ground,  
    and corpses throughout the land.  
    The world as described to me makes no sense,  
    while the world I experience is indescribable.

    Schools only empty me of knowledge;  
    in forgetting, I remember the important things.  
    Too serious and grave, I play the fool;  
    with a child's heart, I see the meaning of it all.

    The faster I move, the longer it takes to arrive;  
    in stillness, I visit every place at every moment.  
    I close my eyes to see, and plug my ears to hear:  
    I fast to train the palate and quench my thirst.

    Now is time to throw away my pen,  
    and begin the real writing:  
    Let all contradictions twirl and blend:  
    There is only He.
