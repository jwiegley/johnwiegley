title: The beauty of southern Oregon

This past weekend I went on a camping trip with my brother, my
sister-in-law, and several of their friends. While there I was able to
[[file:gallery/Oregon/Lake%20Crescent/index.html][take some pictures]],
which reveal some of the beauty of that area. It's a bit like a
different place, so empty, so much nature. I spent much of my time
lazing around, reading from "Walden", and of course, taking walks with
my camera.
