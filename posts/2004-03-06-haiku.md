| Quietly before the rains,
| the breezes tremble:
| moist, warm, eager.
|
| Ever falling raindrops,
| a look of silence,
| the sound of the wind.
|
| Scattered clouds above,
| dancing amidst the blue,
| conjuring sun.
|
| Yesterday: wet palm leaves
| bowing to the applause
| of raindrops.
|
| Whenever you speak to me:
| I am the sugar cube,
| you are the rain.
|
| I lie in my bed,
| dreaming of yesterday --
| then you stir.
|
| The rich, creamy fog
| blowing in like a dream
| envelops even my sighs.
|
| Tapping eaves full of snow --
| my muffled surprise!
| So cold, the struggle.
|
| When I unfold your picture,
| my blood and my heart:
| not regular, not now.
|
| See the red-green frog
| tasting mosquitoes?
| Hasn't found his favorite yet.
|
| As I listen to Chopin
| my heart unfolds --
| I even feel the honeybees.
|
| The mother bares her breast.
| The crying babe.
| The silence.
|
| When I read your letter,
| the clock's hands
| like two bearded dervishes.
|
| Comes the evening
| of this hopeless longing,
| only the moon, the sky so red.
|
| My hair lies about me
| in tattered heaps.
| Such grief.
|
| I see my friend across the room.
| My hands wave wildly,
| and paint the picture of hello.
|
| When mystics gather round
| the fire is lit
| before the logs are brought.
|
| Coffee skin; eyes, chocolate --
| a dollop of cream
| between the lips.
|
| Gossamer skirts
| that trail in the breeze...
| attendant ghosts.
|
| A giant dipped his hand in the sun,
| leaving a white thumbprint
| between the stars.
|
| A silver fish leaps;
| a grey cat watches...
| and nothing more.
|
| The birds in lazy, looping circles.
| The clouds have gone.
| Not a sound.
|
| The wet sand remembers
| where my feet go,
| but easily forgets.
|
| Inhale the salt air...
| one of those times
| you taste with your nose.
|
| Beneath the pale of mid-day,
| birds are weaving
| but forget their thread.
|
| The night, the moon lonely;
| a still, reflective silence,
| the waves murmuring below.
|
| Trees upthrust from the soil
| reach for the sun
| and do not look back.
|
| A conference among the clouds,
| the flash of argument;
| tears of reconciliation.
|
| Blurred images of speed,
| plummeting, racing --
| a small, quiet splash.
|
| The heat! like a blanket
| I simply can't remove.
| I stick to the bed.
|
| The falling rain:
| how unorchestrated in its sound,
| how symphonous.
|
| Only a thousand stars tonight;
| the lights of the city
| consumed the rest.
|
| The swift river flowing past;
| a motionless fish
| is swimming fiercely.
