As I was playing chess on my favorite online server today
([[http://freechess.org]]), I found myself losing just a tiny bit less
than my typical runs -- where I can easily drop ten games without so
much as a shred of dignity.

The difference this time is that I was calm. It may sound simple, but it
lead to a relation about life that connects to my attitudes in chess:

In chess there is simply no room for negative emotions. Anger will not
help you; frustration will certainly not help you. Being determined to
drive your opponent into the dust will not even help you. In fact, such
attitudes make things far worse, as they cause you to rush your
judgments, underestimate your opponent, and open yourself to irrational
decisions with no connection to the board. If you adopt the attitude
that you "should" be winning -- and that whatever's happening is somehow
the universe being out to get you -- well, on those days my ratings take
a sharp dive.

However, this is not to say that chess should be played without feeling.
In fact, a fine aesthetic sense can greatly assist you, by allowing your
unconscious to express its opinions through showing you that a certain
position "feels wrong". Or feelings of graciousness can lead you to
appreciate your opponent's skill -- and thus permit your mind to see
things from his side, sometimes making his plans much clearer to you.

In short, chess is best played from a standpoint of subtle and joyful
calm: not to be rushed; where winning has little emotional value; and
where the game itself is worthy of a complete absorption of heart (in
the form of caring about the quality of your position) and mind (by
pouring through calculations, rather than ranting why things have
reached their current state).

I only sometimes realize how helpful this is in general -- especially
when dealing with people. But in chess I've found it's essential.
Without it, I just plain lose.
