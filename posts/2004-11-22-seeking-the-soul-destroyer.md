| I am seeking the soul-destroyer!
| whose ways rip and slash and burn.
| As a moth calls out to the flame, I pray:
|
|   Rain down your wrath from heaven;
|   beseech Job a portion of his woes;
|   grant the sea drown my sorrow
|   and fire consume those who know.
|
| O soul-destroyer!
| Make my hands to me
| works of an unknown God;
| my own eyes a mystery,
| my breath the bellows
| of another's despair;
| until my time here
| is so filled with awe
| that wonder prevents
| all knowledge of its passing.
|
| O soul-destroyer!
| Teach me the ways of love
| until I cradle Satan in my arms
| and hear him weep
| all the days of his evil away...
