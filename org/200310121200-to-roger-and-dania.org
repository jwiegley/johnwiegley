#+title: To Roger and Dania

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Love is a land outside of place and time
where the moments are sweet eternities
but those forevers are gone too fast.

The doorways to that region can be found
in a pair of eyes, a smile, or those times
when thoughts and words remain unneeded.

Those who journey there go hand in hand,
holding tight as they cross between the worlds;
for love is a land outside place and time:

So it matters not the where and when,
but the heart who helped you believe it.
