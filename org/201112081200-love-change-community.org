Even though things are not as they could be, things at the present are
as they should or must be. It doesn't mean they will stay that way
tomorrow, or even hours from now, but in the moment itself there is
never any defect:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The wayfarer in this Valley seeth in the fashionings of the True One
nothing save clear providence, and at every moment saith: "No defect
canst thou see in the creation of the God of Mercy: Repeat the gaze:
Seest thou a single flaw?"

#+END_QUOTE

Consider a child: Although they are not what they could be, in their
state of being a child they are what they should be. Further, growth
cannot be stopped! Appreciating the child as a child does not cause him
to remain a child. Change is ineluctable.

We see faults in others because we look at what is in terms of what we
think it should be. We reject it, reserving our love for another time,
another day. This rejection is a form of hate. It is a willful denial of
what is, an earnest wish that it were different. We are left tolerating
the present in a state of inward revulsion, enduring it until our
desired future comes about.

But in this state, how can we serve? Can we truly care for the people,
the situations, that exist here and now? Like the child, loving the
present as perfect in-itself does not preclude change. In fact, it
assists change, is the best guide of change, because we are serving the
person, not who we wish the person to become.

Relative to our potential, all things exist in a state of imperfection.
So if God placed us here to learn how to love, that can only mean loving
things in their "imperfect" state. If the world were suddenly
transformed into its promised future, how could we develop the ability
to love /it/, apart from its outward form?
