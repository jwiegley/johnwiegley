The Chinese classic reads "use four ounces to deflect a thousand
pounds."  I think about people and communication: sometimes if we take
enough time to learn where a person is coming from, we find that we need
only a few words to provoke a reaction which otherwise would require
considerable time to convey.  People are not so critically different
from one another.  Chances are, they've already experienced before, in
some way, what we're trying to express.  So that if we take the time to
discover the condition of their being, we may notice that they are even
teetering on the point of realization, and it requires only the
slightest breath to accomplish all that our words might have done.

As an example, I was talking to a friend one day who was debating
whether philosophy really wasn't just a science that begins with words
and ends with words.  I've spent hours before, in the past, trying to
defend philosophy from this accusation.  But this time, as I was trying
to think of a response to give, the following question occurred to me:
"Do you consider poetry to be something that begins with words and ends
with words?"  She answered no.  When I asked why, she said because it
can change a person -- effect a change in their heart.  I just smiled at
this, and she understood my meaning perfectly.  A handful of words had
accomplished successfully something I'd never been able to do in the
past.
