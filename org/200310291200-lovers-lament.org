#+BEGIN_VERSE
One perfect tear, falling into the ocean waves.
The sky is black, the earth is black,
my heart is black.

Amidst the coiling serpents, the turgid waves,
my tear is devoured,
seeming sweet to the briny fathoms of the sea.

Then more tears come
as her memory grips my heart
  and squeezes,
forcing out a running liquid from my eyes.

Now I stand to leave, and notice the dawn.
All is a cast of gold:
a limitless wealth on the horizon.

As it should be, when I wake from this fated life.
