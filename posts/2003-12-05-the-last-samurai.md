Saw the movie "The Last Samurai" tonight.  It transported me.  The way
it depicted a land of soulful beauty, and people devoted to honoring
that beauty in every action of there lives, spoke to me deeply.  I have
a newfound respect for Tom Cruise now too, and the way he was able to
portray someone coming into contact with that world and falling in love
with it.
