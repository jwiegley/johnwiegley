#+title: Pausing for a moment

#+BEGIN_VERSE
All I would need is to hang like a fish
on the shining hook of that moment,
yanked about whichever way the Fishmonger wished
stripped of my armory scales
robbed of my heart, my lungs
stretched over the burning flames
and roasted into a pale memory --
a moment's taste upon His lips.

Thus am I reunited:
I have found the way to mingle flesh.
It requires only the mystery of that moment...

Yet how quickly they would lead me away;
how quickly they would counsel me never to look again.

I suppose it makes a bad worker
who has such a view of the sky in front of him
into which the wings of his soul
long to escape their frustrated peace.
