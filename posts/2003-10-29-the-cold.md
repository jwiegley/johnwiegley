    The sun was a lover's heart:  
    fiery, ardent, trapped in its own heat.

    Its rays touched my cheek but softly --  
    with only a timid kiss.

    The insistent wind was too much for anything,  
    too much for life.

    My bones filled up with a chill that weighed me down,  
    and my spirit ached for the days of summer.

    Perhaps we don't choose the course of the seasons;  
    perhaps all are subject to bitterness hiding the sweet.

    If only life were a thing made to order,  
    poems such as this would never exist.
