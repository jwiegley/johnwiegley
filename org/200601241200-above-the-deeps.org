#+BEGIN_VERSE
It led the way before me:
cool, and dark
an unending ribbon of night
stretching to meet the horizon.

Its waters had captured an image of heaven --
toying with its lights,
setting the stars to dancing
and making of the moon
  a disk of liquid silver.

What fish gathered below,
I wondered?
what denizens of the mighty river
to contemplate my evening ride?

Yet the boat leapt on, quick prow
slicing through the splashing black;
my face catching the wind
and those untamed waters, my soul.
