#+BEGIN_VERSE
Happiness is a flowing warmth that
  binds us, heart to heart;
and the wings that I'd forgotten
  you've unfolded and made strong.

Up, to heights where even eagles
  cannot dare to soar,
I fly now, carried on a breeze
  of memories that shall never fade.

Always, angel of my heart, always
  is the promise that I make.
Let time watch us fade into mortal dust
  while ever my heart is soaring.
