#+title: Hidden essences

No one has known my soul; not even I. Like a Platonic Form, it shies
from the realm of being. It has never appeared in a mortal shape -- this
in-dwelling essence, my soul -- but it does animate my body.

People have known my body, my face, my voice; but have they known me?
What I am, even I cannot see! And yet, holding a lamp is enough to make
use of its light; essences needn't be understood to make friends with
the individual.

Then what about God? He is "the most hidden of the hidden": anywhere you
look, you cannot find Him. So hidden, even a believer might disbelieve,
if one start demanding evidence.

Perhaps He animates Creation -- the form of His will -- as a soul does
the body, whose actions are the will of the spirit. In that case, we
needn't understand His Essence to form close bonds with His Being. If
His "face" is everywhere, perhaps He is "the most manifest of the
manifest": we see Him constantly, in the sense that people see us every
day; even if we never see Him, in the sense that souls remain invisible
to each other.

So are we invisible or do we make friends? Is God far from Us or is He
nearer than our life's vein? If both are true, why emphasize the hidden
nature of God and not dwell on the invisibility of souls? Souls are
hidden, so we pay attention to their personality; then if God is hidden,
shouldn't we focus on the character of Creation, and begin to know it as
the forms of our Lord?
