    See how the wild daisy
    bows in the wind?
    But what does it make
    obeisance to?

    To you, looking on,
    it pays homage
    to nothing at all.

    So come closer --
    still closer --
    until you too
    feel the breath of Wind
    on your face.

    Only then can you know
    whether that flower
    is a wise one
    or a fool.
