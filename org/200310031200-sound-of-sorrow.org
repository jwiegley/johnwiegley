#+title: Sound of sorrow

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Is the sound of sorrow
limited, like a voice's cry?

Or does the soul's suspiration
heed no boundaries of space or time?

The winds of late have seemed
to hold a deeper tone;

More than just the capping of waves
along the rolling blue.

Was that your soft weeping I heard?
or were those salty drops the ocean's own...
