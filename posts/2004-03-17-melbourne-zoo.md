    Giraffe: tall, long-headed -- a tongue of 40cm  
    Sloping back, checkered spots;  
    he slips away to nibble on some palm leaves.

    Kangaroo hopping up, biting the finger of a youngster  
    whose Mom finds it amusing!  
    A beautiful coat of orange-brown,  
    very interested in people.

    Wombat: squat, fat, slow.  Burrowing.  
    A burrowed mound for a home.  
    Not moving an inch: a lazy gopher the size of a watermelon.
