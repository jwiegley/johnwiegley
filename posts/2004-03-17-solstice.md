    The warm summer nights have now betrayed me,
    turned cold, winter winds that ice the bone,
    beneath a moonless sky of shadow, velvet.

    Yet through the dotted black, watching for the sun to rise,
    hands pressed tight to fend the zephyr's howl,
    I remember what the solstice brings, besides just cold and sorrow:

    It signals the eternal promise,
    that whatever was far will come near again,
    to return, just as surely, though slowly, as before.
