#+BEGIN_VERSE
Poetry, music, or art
is something we use to equate
ourselves with a greater beauty outside.

In the falling leaves of autumn,
or the raindrops that lie with sadness on the ground,

We behold something in nature --
isolated for a single moment by our attention --
that draws out from our hearts
an impulse toward something greater.
