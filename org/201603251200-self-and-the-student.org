title: Self and the student

I've mentioned before that perhaps spirituality consists of the degree
to which one has truly recognized the Manifestation of God, and devoted
themselves to His instruction. In this vein, an analogy occurred to me
that could describe how self, or /nafs/, fits into the picture.

Imagine Albert Einstein had decided to give an advanced course on
physics at the University. As a student attending the class, it is
impossible to really appreciate who Einstein is -- apart from reputation
-- until the class is over and all its material absorbed. That is,
during the process of learning, a student must /necessarily/ fail to
appreciate the depth of his master, else their roles should be reversed.
And the greater the teacher, the greater this gap.

Thus, the most important thing for a student to progress is to eliminate
everything he thinks he knows about the subject, whenever his teacher
tells him he does not understand something. This includes not only
facts, but also opinions, ideas, and his very conception of the subject.
If Einstein tells us that the Earth travels in a straight line, and not
in circles around the Sun, we should discard our thoughts immediately,
and ask: why was our understanding so flawed?

"Self" is that impulse within us to hold onto ignorance as if it were
knowledge, despite being corrected by the very Source of knowledge.
There is a strange obstinacy in us, perhaps a defense mechanism?, that
interferes terribly with the learning process if we are not fully
committed to being changed. In fact, this tendency must "die", so that
knowledge may be "born", since the deepest understandings are highly
abstract and subtle, and requiring shifts in perception that cannot
occur unless we are willing.

In a spiritual context, the Divine Educator has gifted us with a perfect
knowledge, but we cannot receive it until every last trace of
misconception is eliminated; and our tendency to cling to shadows, in
spite of the rising Sun, is put to rest.
