#+title: How can I speak

#+BEGIN_VERSE
How can I speak without using Your voice?
What power of mine can move my tongue?

Which of these words did I bring into being?
How much of their meaning was authored by me?

Did I create the phenomenon of sound?

In fact, what of "me" exists in the world?
How can I abstract myself from Creation?

Then there is only Him: "There is no God but He."
What I call "soul" is a function of His singleness.

I cannot even say "I am"; only that "He is".
Everything I thought was "I" is "He" --

In this, one of His many forms,
reflected from this humble point of being.
