#+title: Seeking truth

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Seek truth where it may be found:
No one asks if the sun is shining;
no one ponders if the band still plays;
no one questions the firmness of the ground.

Plato's company shuffled from the cave,
and found the fact of light is blinding.
To a thirsty man, water is the proof;
to the hungry, food is their book of Revelation.

Not theories can warm the coldness of the night;
brilliant thoughts won't compete with a single Ray.
Ask the lover for this or that proof --
he will bleed to show you the way.
