#+BEGIN_VERSE
The paper was pure white,
and then I scribbled over it.
Was it worthwhile?
Was my impact on life sufficient?

I think my death should be simple, invisible,
and my tombstone free of words --
so that only my actions remain.

The thought that troubles me is this:
will such special ink
be strong enough to preserve my memory?
