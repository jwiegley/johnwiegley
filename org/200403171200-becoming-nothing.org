#+title: Becoming nothing

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The longing of a lover's eyes,
draped in fire,
fanned by the agony of time;
neither sleep, nor food,
only the sublimity of the heart's emotion,
seeking out that kiss
which transforms him into nothing...

Only as nothing can the human heart
withstand the lover's stare;
only as empty can it be filled,
only as void can it know being --
like the ear which does not speak
and the mouth which does not hear,
as long as we proclaim, proclaim, unceasing,
her words cannot be heard:
"I am here."
