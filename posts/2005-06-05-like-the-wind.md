| You were like the wind in my life:
| sometimes bitter cold,
| sometimes you embraced me.
|
| When you blew hard
| it ruined all the fragile things;
| and when you blew gently
| it was enough to move me.
|
| On warm days you were a south wind
| bringing hope and renewal;
| but in the winter season
| I could sense the end was near.
|
| You were never anything I could grasp
| even though I felt you:
| When I reached out, there you were;
| as I closed my arms, there was nothing.
|
| You dried my tears and burned my lips.
| You made the heat bearable
| and the cold even worse.
|
| You were like a dance --
| a sweeping cloud of leaves --
| but the steps were just beyond me.
|
| Friend of hawks! stirrer of deep waves,
| beginner of storms
| and end to my peace and calm...
|
| My wind-vane points the way
| but I can't catch up.
| You were always on the move:
| heading towards me, running away.
|
| I hear news of you.  They tell stories.
| But however far you go
| to my thoughts you keep returning.
