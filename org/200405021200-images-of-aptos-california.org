#+title: Images of Aptos, California

A friend and I looked after a mutual friend's kids for a little while,
so we walked them down to Hidden Beach, in Aptos, California.
[[file:gallery/California/Aptos/index.html][This collection]] shows
photographs of that beautiful part of the California coast.

Of the photos taken, all of them were in done in one of the various
"Auto" supported by my camera, the Canon Digital Rebel. I finished
reading the manual last night, but haven't yet tried adjusting things
like the shutter speed and exposure. The Rebel has various automatic
settings for different subjects; most of the photos in the collection
were done in landscape mode, with a few done as closeups or portraits.

It has been a very easy camera to use so far, with none of its features
"getting in my way". I even turned off the digital preview in order to
pay more attention to the shot itself, taking multiple shots if I really
cared about the image. The pictures of the shoes above was the second of
two shots taken in the same mode. The first version was too blurry,
however, because apparently my hands had moved. It showed me how useful
multiple shots are! Out of 150+ photos, a third made it past the cutting
floor.

The shoes are owned by one of the little girls we took to the beach; and
that was exactly how she left them behind her, before she ran to rescue
more seashells from the encroaching waves.
