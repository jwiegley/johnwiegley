#+BEGIN_VERSE
I have waited so long for a companion,
with whom, hand in hand,
we could sit by the ocean
and unravel the experiences we've each had with life --

Not our everyday encounters,
but real life

Come! Come! Be with me.

I want to hear our voices carry us
into the darkest recesses of the night.
