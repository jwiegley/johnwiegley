I have been thinking about poetry recently, and how the experience of
writing it has changed for me over the years. These thoughts are
condensed in a brief essay: [[file:adventures.poetry][Adventures in
Poetry]].

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
I lift my pen, my wand
and conjure fair spells
to entrance the heart,
granting it power to fly...

Love is a doorway to impossible lands.
