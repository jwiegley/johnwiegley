#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
It can all be said  in one word  if our hearts share  the
vocabulary.

But even then,
it's not to be said --
better if shown --
the nights themselves
will tell the meaning.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"Only heart to heart can speak the bliss of mystic knowers; no messenger
can tell it, and no missive bear it."

#+END_QUOTE

Perhaps I overwhelm the readers, since these days I write for my own
joy. Should I end it? If you, too, haven't the will to follow, I doubt
anyone else does.
