    I kissed your lips and my death began.  
    I am a little less each day.

    I cannot eat or drink;  
      I am fasting.  
    I cannot rest;  
      I hold vigils.  
    I beg you for a single glance;  
      I am praying.  
    I give you everything I have;  
      I pay alms.  
    I cross the world to see you;  
      they call me pilgrim.  
    I sing your praises always;  
      I am a teacher.  
    I hang on your every word;  
      I am a disciple.

    The wiles of your beauty have taught me well:  
    Love is the secret of religion.
