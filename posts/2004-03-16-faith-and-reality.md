title: Faith and reality

I have come to believe that faith has the power to create new realities.
This theme recurred to me after watching the film "Artificial
Intelligence", in which a robot boy's wish to become real -- so his
found-mother would love him -- begins a chain of events that lead him
ultimately to his goal.  That "responsiveness" on the part of life to
our wishes is something I've reflected on for some time now, having seen
its effect again and again.  Nor do I think faith alone has this power,
but that the yearnings of the soul are somehow heard -- and answered.
From the Bahá'í Writings:

> Spirit has influence; prayer has spiritual effect.  Therefore, we
> pray, "O God!  Heal this sick one!"  Perchance God will answer.  Does
> it matter who prays?  God will answer the prayer of every servant if
> that prayer is urgent.  His mercy is vast, illimitable.  He answers
> the prayers of all His servants.  He answers the prayer of this plant.
> The plant prays potentially, "O God!  Send me rain!"  God answers the
> prayer, and the plant grows.  God will answer anyone.  He answers
> prayers potentially.  Before we were born into this world did we not
> pray, "O God!  Give me a mother; give me two fountains of bright milk;
> purify the air for my breathing; grant me rest and comfort; prepare
> food for my sustenance and living"?  Did we not pray potentially for
> these needed blessings before we were created?  When we came into this
> world, did we not find our prayers answered?  Did we not find mother,
> father, food, light, home and every other necessity and blessing,
> although we did not actually ask for them?  Therefore, it is natural
> that God will give to us when we ask Him.  His mercy is
> all-encircling.[^1]

Prayer being the expression of faith, the certitude of an answer, the
certainty of being heard: and yet, even if not in prayer, and only the
heart's longing -- if sincere -- I wonder that life doesn't relish such
spirit, and in return do whatever it can to make our hopes real...

Life these past months, though fraught with change and pain and some
anxiety, has been like a dream constantly unfolding.  Am I the dreamer,
watching events come open like petals of flowers -- or am I the dream,
and the life I see around me, the truest definition of myself?
