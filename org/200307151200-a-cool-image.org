#+title: A cool image

#+BEGIN_VERSE
The vapors rising off the ice:
a sublime landscape of winter:
arctic pieces of the sea trapped
in the white amber of millennia.

The seals below bump their heads,
the bears in white coats rumble their hunger;
against the black night, the white fox howls
and the rabbit hears him in the echoes of sleep.
