    Reaching for heaven,
    I draw back fingers burnt by the sun;
    and ponder the endless skies
    my hands can never touch...

    Made from the dust of stars
    I am planet bound --
    longing to fly, but having no wings.

    Then let this poem be my flight:
    I will gather up dreams
    beneath wings of prayer
    and traverse, in my mind's eye, every distance
    until I leave this Earth behind
    and, without moving,
    stride among the heavens.
