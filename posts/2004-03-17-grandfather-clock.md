| She's only six, and the tension is terrible;
| If only this hour would be on its way!
| Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
| Parcels out time in infinitesimal moments
| Until for her, eternity has finally passed away.
|
| He is sixteen, with eyes in the clouds,
| While his teacher drags him back to class.
| Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
| Counts a second for a second;
| Until sixty times sixty
| Rewards his patience at last.
|
| The man and woman with "Baby on Board"
| Are a few minutes late -- and not one to spare!
| Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
| Steals an hour from their lives,
| And leaves them rapt in despair.
|
| A gentleman with a watch
| Watches the watch watch him.
| Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
| Is a year off his life
| And what's left grows dim.
|
| Grandfather at last! for whom the clock was built.
| It's not too late for that old gray head.
| Each tick and tock of the grandfather clock
| Is a lifetime -- a journey:
| For with each tick he's reborn.
| And with each tock, struck dead.
