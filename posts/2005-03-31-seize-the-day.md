| Does the wind also
| whisper to you
| its word of welcome?
| Or do you only hear
| the rustling of leaves...
| Leave behind the world you see
| and enter the one now standing
| just before your eyes.
| I say: it is not a tree,
| not bark and branch and bough,
| but let my heart name it
| and I call it majesty.
|
| Every day of your life
| the noble mysteries have been
| your confidant.
| They have heard every sigh
| watched every joy and sorrow
| come and go.
| So peek out, before the chance
| escapes you.
| See what wonder hides
| even upon this page.
| For age will someday
| make honest men of all
| and some rise to glory's heights
| and some to mourning fall.
