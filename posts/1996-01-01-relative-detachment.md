title: Relative detachment

The detachment mentioned in the Seven Valleys is not absolute
detachment.  It is detachment from all things *save God*.  This detachment
occurs because one becomes so enamored of God, there is room for nothing
else.

Anyone who has fallen in love can relate to this experience.  In those
moments of communion with the beloved, everything else in the world
disappears -- time, place, consciousness of self, etc. -- as if the
lover were carried away on a sea of bliss, tossed by waves that know
nothing, wish for nothing.

To attempt detachment by any means other than absorption in God is a
terrific task.  I think the Writings indicate that so All-Sufficing is
the nature of God (as revealed by His Manifestations), that in His
presence we would not find detachment rare at all, or precious, but
simply the natural result of devaluing of every lesser thing.  As Rumi
describes it, the invisibility of the candle when placed before the sun.

To find this, we must be willing to cease paying so much attention to
worldly things, or cherishing the hope that they will grant us any peace
or happiness.  This is not "detachment" yet, but a prerequisite along
the Path.  The more time we spend in prayer, and reflection on the
transient nature of the world, the more we discover that only the former
offers anything in the way of peace.
