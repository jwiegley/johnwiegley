#+BEGIN_VERSE
We spoke each other's name
into the late hours.

I, in voice, since Yours are
the Most Beautiful Names;
and You, in silence,
aptly naming my nothingness.

Until dawn
we went on like that,
my myriad questions
  always answered by the same reply...
What silent wisdom! Truly:
"Knowledge is a single point."

I raised up my hands
and you held me with unseen Arms.
We danced until the stars
returned to the void.

I pray, and the words are Your own.

So, without power
  to move or breath,
I close my eyes and open Yours...

...and watch
  the stirrings of the Dawn.
