| To me,
| my days are as diamonds.
| The moments of my life
| are a precious gold;
| the minutes and the hours -- priceless.
|
| I should not sell them cheaply.
| If I do not have time
| for what concerns me most,
| then who has my time?
| And at what price did I barter it away?
|
| A loving Creator
| has created this mote of love.
| My seconds are the soul of the gift.
| They are, in fact, all that I am.
| There can never be a dearer possession.
|
| O, do not waste my days
| in concern of where I am going!
| or even of what I have been.
| The Lover has summoned His friends.
| Relax... enjoy the relationship.
