    Ah, true, sleepless one,
    I will ever write;
    it is only a question,
    should ears hear?
    or the river Tigris
    swallow the black tears
    that runs in drops of ink
    along these pages...

    Perhaps I feel echoes
    of that joy Bahá'u'lláh
    had known
    writing for His heart's Revelation
    but knowing none could hear.

    I possess no capacities as such
    yet every being
    is a symbol created
    by the accents of His voice.
