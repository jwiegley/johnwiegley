    Gathering together its full force  
      of howling wind, whipped on  
      by the fiercest of riders -- Nature enraged --

    It carries on, gorging itself on towns  
      of helpless, screaming victims  
      tossing aside the endeavors of man  
      more easily than a house of cards  
      that yields to the furious thump of its master's fist;

    All blown aside, digested into small fragments:  
      the bones, dust and people's dreams:  
      disappeared like the breeze of a dead summer.

      Where are they now?  
      And where will I be,  
      if such a torrent lay its awful hands on my life?
