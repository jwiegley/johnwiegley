#+BEGIN_VERSE
So good is my King
that I understand it not.

His words, not true, but truth itself,
Glorious, Exalted, Most Praiseworthy!

I praise Him, not for reason's sake nor desert,
but this: He is the very meaning of the act.

If He cast me out from His great City
beyond walls and moats, alone in sadness,
forsaken, wondering what wisdom is this...

He is a most gracious sovereign!
and the greatest host!

By remoteness, He draws me near;
by darkness, sharpens my sight.

So good is my King
that I understand it not.

My love for Him must never be
conditioned on His love for me.
