    How do I know I'm in love?

    If her touch steals time  
    and her breathing slows it  
    but her absence makes it long.

    If her thoughts of me  
    are how I know myself,  
    her lips blurring right and wrong.

    If my heart is her creation:  
    her smile saving me, he frown destroying me --  
    a gate to both world in her eyes!

    If faced by the road of self-destruction  
    careless, I court my soul's demise.
