    Far-away blue
    farther than my sight reaches
    hinting at the empty black of space beyond
    so vast it loses its meaning.

    The pen, the writer
    this dot on paper
    lost in the infinite blue.

    I am less than a thought
    less than the uncreated sentence
    as much nothing
    as the limitless arms of a night sky
    embracing four trillion worlds.

    Until the magic happens
    the mystic's thaumaturgy
    who blends in a formless soup the scene and seer
    until both are one
    and this shadow on a bright day writing
    is christened "self"

    A moment within the universe of who I am.
