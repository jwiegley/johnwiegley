#+BEGIN_VERSE
Spring has come
stealing dew from the leaves
to make flowers:
a fecund dance
of seed and soil and sun.

The pregnant Earth,
the watering sky;
all the land giving birth:
a hoarde of children
who scream with their colors...

The bees are dressed in banded aprons,
gathering what can be gathered,
making their honeyed draught.
Love is in the air, this season.
What will you make of it?
