| O lovely moth!
| who at every dusk
| strives for his moon
| with the same hope
| as the night before.
|
| Her silver light
| is your treasure;
| the stars, your diamonds;
| each flame, a flowing gold.
|
| The ache in your wings
| is fond communion;
| the wind in your eyes, a kiss;
| every fire, a luminous doorway
| you leave the cloak of self beside.
|
| O master of search
| and paragon of love!
| knower of ends
| and prince of journeys!
|
| Eyes lit ablaze —
| now ash upon the breeze —
| you float to such heavens
| as you always knew could be.
