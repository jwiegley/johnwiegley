    One evening, like any other,  
    I happened to notice the sky.

    Whatever I was doing, I had forgotten her;  
    my eyes, so eager for beauty, had looked away.

    But that next moment...  
    who can tell what I saw?  
    Even my own memory is imperfect:

    It was a lake of fire,  
    held by its glowing heat  
    over a sea like rolling steel;  
    it was a river of luminous wine  
    poured in a furnace of bright warmth.

    The sea itself lapped, like a man half-asleep,  
    dreamily curling, and uncurling, onto the shore...
