| Silence. Cold thoughts.
| The procession of phantoms in a dark world of dreams.
| I am summoning memories, trying to reflect,
| seeking understanding in the vapors and steams.
|
| The cauldron boils and demons writhe --
| everything readies to pierce through the veil.
| My thinking submits to the mysteries of old;
| my consciousness cracks -- I am beyond the pale.
|
| Too late for memories of the world and its woes;
| too late for hope and the sadness it knows.
| The spell is unleashed and the time is at hand:
| now witness the power I have at command!
|
| Choice at my left hand, Fate to my right;
| I look at them both
|   and see the mysteries of night...
