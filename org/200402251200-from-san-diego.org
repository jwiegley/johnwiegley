#+title: From San Diego

I'm typing now from a coffee shop in San Diego, visiting with a computer
friend I've known for years, but never met face-to-face. How nice
computers allow friends to meet despite physical boundaries.

And such a lovely city; its fine breezes and candied lights under the
night sky, waving palms, the ocean's subtle, salty air. California is a
magical place.
