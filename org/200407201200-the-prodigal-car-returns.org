After less than a day, thanks to the efforts of my local police, my car
has been returned. It was found somewhere in the next city over (Daly
City, which is between me and San Francisco). So now, with a new air
mattress, it seems things are restored. An odd day of bus riding and
visiting police departments to fill out forms. But still that sense of
life being a bit amusing. I wonder if it's all just a test.
