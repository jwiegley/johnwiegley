#+title: The mood of night

#+BEGIN_VERSE
A mood of night
settles on the trees,
on the satin of dark waters,
on the rocks and the creatures
of the watery deep.

The moon is a bold eye
watching the land of evening;
sewing by his regard
tiny pearl-drops of light
that tempt the oyster's envy.

And in the far-off, apace:
an isle of moonlight
drifts beneath the silent glow,
a carpet of lambent silver
against the mood of night.
