How do we choose a "Way" to follow? We have to ascertain whether someone
is qualified to give us Laws, and then follow them. A child can't judge
by himself which of his parent's rules are necessary and which aren't.
Trying to assess the words of the Prophets this way leads to endless
arguments.

Likewise, a patient does not find a good doctor by seeking the "correct
prescription" for his illness. Only a doctor can know that. Instead, we
look for the signs of skill and experience which distinguish a good
doctor, and put ourselves in his hands.
