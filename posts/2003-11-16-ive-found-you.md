title: I've found you

    I have waited so long for a companion,
    with whom, hand in hand,
    we could sit by the ocean
    and unravel the experiences we've each had with life --

    Not our everyday encounters,
    but real life

    Come!  Come!  Be with me.

    I want to hear our voices carry us
    into the darkest recesses of the night.
