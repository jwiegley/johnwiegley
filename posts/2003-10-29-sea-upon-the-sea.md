    When the foggy tides  
    surge upon the land,  
    filling in the spaces  
    of the grey-bricked cities  
    and the meadows of green,  
    and the anodyne hills,  
    pluming everywhere like smoke  
    from a Great Father's pipe...

    Then it seems like  
    a sea upon the sea,  
    with buoys that flash red  
    where the skyscrapers dreamed;  
    and perhaps a poet or two  
    watching from his fog beach  
    musing at the millions  
    who've become fish, unawares.
