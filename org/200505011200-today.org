#+title: Today

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I find myself happy today
for one thing above all:
that I've learned what it means
to like one's self completely.

Certainly not because of
any degree of perfection;
that, I was never able to achieve.

But as I look at
the people around me --
the variety of characters,
  attitudes, activities --
I find a certain, indescribable beauty
pervades them all.

Life is not about
what is deserved -- but what is;

And if we fail to recognize
this amazing beauty before us,
so evident -- right here,
in this company, right now --

If we neglect to perceive
what it's trying to show,
we will have missed out
on a precious opportunity.
