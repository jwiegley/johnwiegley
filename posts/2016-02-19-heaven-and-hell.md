    In Heaven
    thirst is prized:
    it reveals the flavor of water;
    drinking is prized:
    it unites one with the Source;
    and the Ocean is life
    the Object of all desire.

    But in Hell
    thirst is torment:
    it reveals what is lacking;
    drinking is despised:
    it cannot satisfy;
    and the Ocean is death
    to the burning flame of desire.
