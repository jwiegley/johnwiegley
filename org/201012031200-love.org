#+BEGIN_VERSE
When you love,
you embrace change;
you welcome change;
but you don't desire change.

When you love,
every day is deeper;
each day is greater;
but it's always enough.

When you love,
a drop is more refereshing than oceans;
a crumb is more than a feast;
one moment, longer than eternity.
And yet, it's never enough.
but you don't desire change.

...a drop is more refereshing than oceans;

a bite is more than a feast;

...And yet, it's never enough.
