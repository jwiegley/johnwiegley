People's obsession with alien abduction may boil down to a feeling that
something superior is among us, secretly, acting toward an unknown end.
Which unknown could be negative or positive.

A lot of myths follow this picture, going back to the Greek and Roman,
in which the gods often entered into human affairs secretly.

Going all the way back, perhaps this is a mythos which exemplifies the
relationship that man has had with God since the beginning. The details
of this relationship are inscribed in our psyche, and play themselves
out at every time in history, only differing the details.
