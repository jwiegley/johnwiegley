    In the branches
    where the wind blows
    and daylight fights the shadows
    I found you.

    Your head tilted back
    admiring the clouds
    in deep repose of thinking;
    I wondered,

    What thought-strewn sea
    surges up?
    What white-clead breakers
    bear down
    and crash upon that brow?

    Such storms within
    to counterpoint
    the tranquil skies above.
