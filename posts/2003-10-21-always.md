    Happiness is a flowing warmth that
      binds us, heart to heart;
    and the wings that I'd forgotten
      you've unfolded and made strong.

    Up, to heights where even eagles
      cannot dare to soar,
    I fly now, carried on a breeze
      of memories that shall never fade.

    Always, angel of my heart, always
      is the promise that I make.
    Let time watch us fade into mortal dust
      while ever my heart is soaring.
