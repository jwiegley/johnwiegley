    I watched a mime
    think he could paint the sky with his touch;
    his hands, dipped in white paint,
    drawing strokes that left no imprint.

    Unless it was not the air
    he meant to reach,
    and his canvas
    not the emptiness around him...

    But the eyes of his watchers,
    their little easels of hearts
    capturing each vanishing motion
    in the fondness of memory.
