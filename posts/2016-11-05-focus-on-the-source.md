The mountain in front of you can be conquered step by step. Connect with
Bahá’u’lláh, not the form and image of what Bahá’í looks like. Hold on to that
connection even if things get weird and rocky.

Virtue doesn't exist to judge you. Think of a violin: it is always capable of
great music, but needs tuning and training to reach its purest notes. You are
that violin. Even now, however badly you may feel, the perfection is right
there with you, always a part of you. The point of virtue is not to show you
how far you have to go, it's to help you realize the infinite beauty shining
from your own heart.

Focus on the Source. Know that He loves you more than anyone can; He cares
more than is reasonable; He is merciful beyond His justice. He is a Friend
that will never give up on you, no matter what. Think of that, and not
yourself. Make it the center of your life, and naturally you'll want to
strengthen the relationship.

Outward forms are always the greatest challenge. They can be so depressing, so
defeating. God is "closer to you than your life's vein". Even if you lose
sight of it for a brief time, you have never left. The sun shines eternally,
no matter if there are clouds, no matter if the Earth has turned its back for
the night.
