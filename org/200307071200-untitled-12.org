It is true that I value intellect over feelings. To make one's choices
by feeling alone, following the path that feels right, is the way of the
animal. Man alone possesses the gift of intellect, a rational soul, and
it is by the use of it that we distinguish ourselves, and are able to
make choices based on what is just and true, rather than what feels
good.

That said, it is also not infallible, since it is only as good as the
assumptions we feed into it. Feeling can assist in testing those
assumptions. I have included a passage below on the different kinds of
proof.

I also value feeling as a part of the whole of life, and think that
feeling good is a very good indicator of the right choice. By this I
mean joy more than physical pleasure: the kind of pleasure that proceeds
from the happiness of the soul in doing what is right.

It is by our intellect that we learned that the world was round, the sun
is at the center of the solar system, and how to fly. None of these
"felt" right; there are still people -- though few -- who argue against
them because they defy common sense. The church and society opposed
every one of these discoveries, because they felt so wrong at the time.
