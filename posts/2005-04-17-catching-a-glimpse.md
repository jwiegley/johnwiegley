    The wind one morning
    carried Your voice to me;
    but when I turned my head
      it was gone.

    Looking up one night
    a sparkling Light caught my eye;
    but when I turned my head
      it was gone.

    A fragrance on the breeze
    enchanted both heart and mind;
    but when I turned my head
      it was gone.

    Until at last
    the thought came to me:
      Why do I keep turning away?
