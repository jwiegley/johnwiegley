    In a dream, I imagine I've lost my arm.
    I'm walking past the city,
    past the towns,
    into the Blue Dandenong hills.

    There, as I look back,
    it seems a miller had stoked a fire in the sea.
    The clouds form a satin robe:
    regal with violet, crimson and gold.

    At the center of it, the royal heir:
    Prince of Life,
    fiery Lover of the Earth,
    the Gracious King.

    It is too much beauty
    for one man to behold alone...

    I lept to my feet,
    the will to applaud rushing through me
    so powerfully,
    so irresistibly,

    That on that day
    where the grasses whisper,
    carried by the wind from where I stand,
    you could hear the sound of one hand clapping.
