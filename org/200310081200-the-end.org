#+BEGIN_VERSE
Happiness is the real real.
It is the fire in the dark of night --
the sound of the Loved One's name.
Consider it the endless blue
when the last cloud has gone.

And that blue, that emanation:
whence comes the light?
That you may know:
the soul is the looking
and the feeling
of the forms of the Looked Upon.

You carry within you,
by the signature of your own reality,
full knowledge of the beginning and end.

When these two purposes --
Hoped For, and hope --
find their harmony,
then happiness gives reason for it all.

Pure, unwritten;
not theories or words.
Until you know it
without reference to knowledge,
life must remain a mystery.
