#+BEGIN_VERSE
So many things to study, to know,
not only a million facts
but a million points of view...

The skies of man's endeavor
are filled with countless lights!
each standing bold against
the empty backdrop of night.

No one can count them all.
Every season brings a new configuration.
Run, run to catch up, but they outpace you.

Then comes the Dawn of understanding.

The True Orb touches the horizon,
Its first rays bringing all to naught;
the very meaning of "seeker" vanishes
when he enters the presence of the Sought.

One Light in Heaven,
all lesser things be gone,
even the blackness between
now a glowing shade of blue.

On that Day, there is only Him.
Whatever else had seemed of interest
must fall to Heaven's coup.
