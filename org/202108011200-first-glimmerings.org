We have been gifted the first glimmerings of a vision of humanity that
transcends the differences currently tearing us apart. In everything we
do, we can be a beacon of hope toward this vision. Racism needs to end,
as does materialism and slavish devotion to image and rank. Dismantling
is not enough. People need to know there is something better on the
other side, that this great adventure is only beginning, that there are
reasons to sacrifice for it with joy. We can reflect this in our words,
actions and attitude, and it will have an effect. We can touch the heart
of every righteous man! It begins with transforming our inward life,
then moving outward to combat the dark with candle-like sacrifice of
time and effort. And it needn't be always through acts of heroism; every
crashing river is the united action of mere drops.
