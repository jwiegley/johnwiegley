title: Recognition as an interpretive theme

Recognition of God's Manifestation is "the first duty prescribed by God for
His servants", yet this weighty theme may imply much more than just
acknowledgement of the station claimed by Bahá'u'lláh, perhaps offering an
approach to interpreting certain mystical statements that appear at first to
have difficult or impossible implications.

For instance, Bahá'u'lláh has written about the Seven Valleys that "any soul
who turns his face towards the Supreme Horizon and recognizes God hath already
traversed the seven valleys or seven stations mentioned in that work."
[provisional] Given the exalted character of the stations described in that
text, this seems to imply that recognition of God is a fundamental,
transformative characteristic of Bahá'í mysticism. It goes far beyond the
signing of a declaration card, or associating oneself with His cause, implying
such a change in one's perception of existence that Bahá'u'lláh's statement
that "every created thing in the whole universe is but a door leading into His
knowledge" becomes read not only as a lofty theme, but as depicting the
underlying fabric of spiritual awareness.

If certain Bahá'í mystical Writings are examined from the perspective of this
recognition, they can take on a different character from interpretations
centered on the individual seeking to achieve them. For example, Bahá'u'lláh's
statement that "the heart wherein the least remnant of envy yet lingers, shall
never attain My everlasting dominion", rather than indicating that the heart
must be purged of envy before the kingdom can be found, could be stating that
so wondrous is His Revelation, that one has not yet found its kingdom so long
as anything remains with power to beguile the seeker's heart.

Likewise other texts, including the stages and degrees of the Seven Valleys
and Gems of Divine Mysteries, can offer new insights when this recognition is
taken as a central point being made, presenting the idea that progression
through these stages may result from deepening one's vision, and thus
recognition, of the station of Bahá'u'lláh, the Ancient Beauty.
