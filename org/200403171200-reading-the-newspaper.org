#+title: Reading the newspaper

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Ahead of me faced a long hall
seemingly dedicated to blackness.
From either side, through closed doors,
I heard screams and tired sighs;
moans that betrayed an impatient anguish
and a longing for an end to life.

Nearby, someone tapped me on the shoulder,
causing me to look up from my newspaper.
