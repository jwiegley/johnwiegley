#+BEGIN_VERSE
The movements of a train
over long rails
of hardened purpose
a pair of arrows
forever flying sure
the cold steel
impervious to distraction.

The movements of a train
upon the iron rails
without which
the purpose of even
the finest engine
would remain unknown:
a being without
the will to move.
