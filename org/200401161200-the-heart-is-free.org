#+BEGIN_VERSE
Should the moon settle on the waters
appearing bright among the waves,
and lead the mind to tranquil thoughts
of earlier times, and younger days,

Remind the heart: it's still free yet:
there's nothing lost that's not been gained;
it's simply how we look on things
that sometimes feels restrained.
