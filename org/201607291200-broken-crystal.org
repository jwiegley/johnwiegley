#+BEGIN_VERSE
I lived upon a landscape of broken crystal.
My eyes were closed, and my feet, bleeding.

One day I awoke with the sun in my face...
And I fell in love,
and my heart became a mortal cup, filled with light.

I looked across the land as the Daystar rose
and all those crystal thorns became as one:
drops of the sun,
diamonds of fire,
a treasure of light
unbounded.
