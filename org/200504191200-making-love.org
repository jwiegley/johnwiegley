#+BEGIN_VERSE
I'm sitting here
at this proper dinner party.
But I can't help noticing
the fit of the chair beneath me;
how the breeze from outside
brushes against my skin...

The chocolate on my fork
is a kiss on the lips,
and the sweet music
woos me with its song...

How funny, that despite
all these people around me --
You still find ways of making love.
