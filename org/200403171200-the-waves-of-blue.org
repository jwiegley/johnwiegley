#+title: The waves of blue

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Remind me of that time
when the brilliance of dreaming
was the color of a sunrise;

When the rippling waters of Glacier Lake
and the waves of blue
that gathered at my toes

Were exactly what my heart desired,
on a warm day,
beneath the pale clouds of a lazy summer.
