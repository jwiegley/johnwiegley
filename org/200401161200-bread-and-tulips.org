Watched a wonderful movie tonight, named "Bread and Tulips" (Pane e
Tulipani). It reminded me so much of my days in Italy. More so because
the leading actress reminds me of a beautiful friend I made while
staying in Florence (or, how she might look in a few decades). The
phrases people would speak, the setting, the lyrical sense of life
conveyed by the film; all reminded of that time -- a moment in my life
that lingers still.
