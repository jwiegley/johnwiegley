    At one moment, it is too quiet.
    Expectation remakes the stillness
    into a sharp knife
    cutting away at the future...

    Then a tiny puff of sound,
    the tension climbing in pace
    with some unseen shape
    that waiting eyes see too well...

    Then too fierce for the one moment!
    whose gentle, pausing silence
    is ripped into a flash of color
    as a wound from some bright being
    hiding in the blackened clouds
    until...
    that one moment of sound and flash.

    And now the embers of a heavenly fire
    drift slowly back to earth.
