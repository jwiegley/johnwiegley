Dear God,

I am sorry if in the past I have limited our relationship.  I'm not used to
the way things should be between us.  You could say it's all new for me, my
soul just being created and such.  There are a few things it's taking me a
long time to learn.

For example, I keep forgetting how good You are.  I think it's because Your
goodness exceeds my understanding, so I see some of the things You do as
cruelty at first.  It leads me to imagine You as fickle, mean-spirited -- even
petty at times.  That is why, when I call on You, I don't always expect an
answer.  I even assume you ignore me most of the time.  I can't think of one
friend who would treat me this badly, but I expect it of You.  I've entirely
forgotten how good You are, and I'm sorry about that.

You gave me existence for free, and the ability to work, and the power to
appreciate and take advantage of life.  But I still complain about what wasn't
made free, or isn't perfect, or doesn't match my understanding.  Give a
starving man a fish and he eats; give a sated man a fish, and he wonders what
else you've got.  You created me with so many riches, I fear I keep waiting
for what's in Your other hand...

Lastly, I apologize for putting a name to what You are.  This, more than
anything else, has limited our relationship.  Mathematicians write Infinity as
a symbol so it can fit in their equations, just as I use "God" to fit You in
my mind.  But I've forgotten that You have no end.  I try so hard to squeeze
you into my mind and my heart -- to eke out a drop of what You are that I can
call my own -- that I keep forgetting about the power and the beauty and the
untold depths of the Ocean.  I confuse myself by what I know of You, and for
that, again, I'm sorry.

When my parents didn't give me everything I wanted, I often screamed that it
was so unfair.  How sorely did I fail to perceive their love in those
limitations.

Yours (quite literally), John
