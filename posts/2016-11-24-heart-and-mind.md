Imagine someone you've known for many, many years: maybe a spouse, a friend, a
parent.

Look through the eye of the mind, and we might say: we'll never fully know
them. We don't know what they'll do tomorrow, if they'll always be loyal, if
they'll always be kind, if they'll always be the person we know today. The
mind, if it's honest, doesn't know even 0.01% of the mysteries of life.

Look through the eye of the heart, and we might say: we'll never stop loving
them. No matter what they do tomorrow, no matter if they're loyal, no matter
if they're always kind. They'll always be the soul we love today. The heart,
if pure and filled with God, revels in these mysteries like a fish from the
fathomless deeps.

Seeking certainty of mind is to drink the Ocean by cupfuls: you'll never know
the bottom of it. Certainty of heart dives straight in, praying always, "O
Lord, increase my astonishment at Thee!"
