    At dawn she reclined in thought,
    considering the tapestries of Earth,
    finding meaning in the destinies of earth-worms.

    Then morning came.

    With plant-slowness, her arms unfolded,
    and she lifted her leaves to the sun.

    What in the night
    had been a goddess of melancholy,
    reveals colors now
    sadness has never known.
