    Night, tonight
      fair black on
        drops of starling white;
    a dreamer's sea
      for finer sails
        O captains of the light!
    onward ho,
      to heaven's hold
        where angels take their flight
    and join the
      twirl of galaxies
        who dance upon such heights.
