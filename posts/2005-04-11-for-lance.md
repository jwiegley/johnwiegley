    Sunlight
    where do you go?
    I know that at dusk
    you make the mountains glow.
    Your last ray catches my eye
    but I wonder:
    why must you go?
    Why leave me to the dark of night?
    To the cold,
    to the bitter hours...
    The moon's a poor reflection;
    the stars, a distant company.
    Is my only hope to wait?
    To trust we'll meet again?
    My dear sunlight
    where did you go?
