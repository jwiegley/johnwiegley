    Even the sun must leave us,  
    and bow before the greying times  
    between worlds of night and day;

    Then even the night must leave us  
    when colors return, the dew is gone,  
    and beauty takes the breath of eyes away.

    And all must endure parting,  
    a given sorrow, a condition of life:  
    the ordained and chosen Way.

    For if not good-bye, how hello?  
    If not distance, how reunion?  
    Without going, how to come and stay?

    I drink the sweet poison,  
    now turning my fingers numb,  
    in order that, knowingly, I may say:

    Everything divided must rejoin --  
    else the meaning of our separation  
    would not give such cause to pray.
