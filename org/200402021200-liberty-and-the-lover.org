Liberty means being free. But for the lover, this can only mean freedom
to reach his Beloved...

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whither can a lover go but to the land of his beloved? and what seeker
findeth rest away from his heart's desire? To the true lover reunion is
life, and separation is death. His breast is void of patience and his
heart hath no peace. A myriad lives he would forsake to hasten to the
abode of his beloved. -- Bah치'u'll치h

To find the Beloved, the lover must follow a Path toward his Goal. Is he
not free because he must travel a certain direction? Is he not free
because there are disciplines in journeying? Excessive liberty is
wanting to be free from the Beloved as well; but this only proves an
ignorance of self. The true lover sees servitude to Love as paradise.
"Give ear to the sayings of the Friend and turn towards His paradise."

Liberty alone grants sorrow, because the lover knows he is separate.
Thus, the whole purpose for every attribute, principle and capacity,
possessed by humankind, is to sacrifice them all in pursuit of Him, our
true happiness. When we finish playing a game, do we pine for the points
we earned while playing it? Rather, victory is all we aim for, or
remember.

In all these journeys the traveler must stray not the breadth of a hair
from the "Law," for this is indeed the secret of the "Path" and the
fruit of the Tree of "Truth"; and in all these stages he must cling to
the robe of obedience to the commandments, and hold fast to the cord of
shunning all forbidden things, that he may be nourished from the cup of
the Law and informed of the mysteries of Truth. -- Bah치'u'll치h
