title: A fish in the ocean
tags: journal

Consider yourself like a fish, swimming in the heart of the ocean,
searching for water... you think haven't found it because you don't swim
fast enough, or strong enough, or like the fishes of old; or that your
lazy eye, your broken scale, your weak fin is the reason. When, in fact,
nothing can hold you back!

A fish swims in the ocean, and no matter how far it swims there is no
end to the water. A bird flies in the sky, and no matter how far it
flies there is no end to the air. However, the fish and the bird have
never left their elements. -- Dogen
