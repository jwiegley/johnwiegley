title: More thoughts on ego
category: Journal
---

When I'm doing something that goes well, I think about how I'm seeing
God in that too.  He is the Beauty of all beautiful things; He is life
itself.  Ego may always be there, but it, too, is part of this beautiful
drama.  Even in the fact of ego, there is something divine.

So I do not seek to be rid of my ego.  Rather, I desire for *every part
of me* to serve God -- including my ego.  Otherwise, I am setting up a
battle within myself again, and hell comes back into being.

Take for example the Sufi concept of nafs.  The nafs is our
individuality, our unique experience of existence.  It is also a
fiction, an illusion, giving us the idea that we're somehow separate
from God.  As we progress through the Valleys, we ultimately reach the
Valley of Nothingness, when the nafs becomes as nothing before the True
Reality.

However, the nafs is never "discarded".  All the stages of the soul are
in fact stages of the nafs!  The highest degree, "the perfect soul" is
actually "an-nafsu'l-kaamila": the perfect nafs.  That is, we advance by
bringing the nafs into line with God's will, rather than by destroying
it.

Just as we need a mirror to reflect the light of the sun, we need the
nafs to express our servitude and humility -- since it is the nafs, and
not God, who evinces such humility.

Thus I want my nafs, I value my nafs, for the expressions of love it can
make toward my Creator.  It is only by falling in love with my own nafs
that I really go wrong.  The nafs itself is just a tool of our
existence; it deserves neither love nor hate.

This poem sums up what I mean:

It's not that the pen disappears, but that it gets put to its proper
use.  Perhaps you mean "stepping out of the way" by the pen's not
interfering with its own use.  But there is no need for inner conflict,
shunning our creation, or despising anything about ourselves.

All these dichotomies, these fingers pointing at "this" and "that",
"God" and "self" -- are the very reality of "self" whose tyranny we seek
to escape.
