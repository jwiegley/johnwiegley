#+title: Finding the path

#+BEGIN_VERSE
Leave me alone --
to walk through the streets
  unhurried, unhindered,
placing each foot deliberately;
feeling the weight of my body
as it rocks back and forth.

Kids thirst to get through school
  and find a job.
What a useless waste!
if one doesn't understand why he does it.

The world doesn't encourage
time off to think about these things.
They'd prefer to notice the parachute
ten thousand feet from the valley floor
and falling...
