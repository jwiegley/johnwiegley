#+title: Mistakes

Mistakes are not just a thing that happens, they are the ebb and flow of
our lives. Do not think that mistakes will debar future service, because
people will remember them and hold them against us. If God wishes us to
serve in a certain capacity, He will achieve it. We should even be glad
of mistakes for their value, and rejoice in them, because the
alternative is to be ignorant of the fact that we make them all the
time. Being aware is about being conscious; it doesn't relate to the
actual number of mistakes occurring.
