Al-Qushayri, the Sufi scholar, writes that the fear of God (تقوى) has
three aspects: "... full trust in God with respect to what has not been
granted to him; full satisfaction with what has been granted to him; and
full patience with respect to what has eluded him."

In terms of the lover and the Beloved, consider how a lover's heart
would be affected if he were offered a hundred mithqals of gold to
betray his beloved. That reaction, if true to his love, is تقوى. I
believe this state of being is also echoed in the following passage of
the Kitáb-i-Aqdas:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Whoso hath inhaled the sweet fragrance of the All-Merciful, and
recognized the Source of this utterance, will welcome with his own eyes
the shafts of the enemy, that he may establish the truth of the laws of
God amongst men.

#+END_QUOTE

In this state of being, one's chastity of soul (that is, singleness of
desire for God) becomes so refined that even a single misstep from the
Straight Faith would be reckoned as though stepping into white hot fire.

Outwardly it is seen as fear, inwardly it is a condition of being. The
تقوى of the body prevents one from holding their breath too long; the
تقوى of the نفس is clinging to the Law and the Path with every fiber of
one's being; and the تقوى of the spirit (روح) is the continual
testimony: "... all exemplify the truth that there is none other God but
Him".

Even between the lover and his beloved: Something causes him to take
care that his words and actions always express his heart; he never acts
carelessly toward his loved one.
