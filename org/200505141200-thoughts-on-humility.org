#+title: Thoughts on humility

* Being humble
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: being-humble
:END:
I don't think a person can "be" humble, although they can be humbled.
Humility is what we experience when standing before something truly
magnificent. As long as we are mindful of God, we will be humble -- sort
of like when we reflect on the magnitude of the universe (and He created
that with one Word!).

The other "humility" is like hiding under bush so people can't see any
beauty in you. Should a beautiful gem hide itself? If God created it
such, then it is what it is. Humility is what we feel before God and His
creation, not a condition we manufacture.

This implies that if one feels pride, the best answer is to turn to God
(isn't that the answer for everything?) and recall what is truly Great
-- rather than turn to ourselves and revise our self-assessment into
something bitterly mundane. God's attributes appear in the mirrors of
created things, after all, and human nature is the most excellent of
these.

* Receiving praise

When a flower delivery boy appears at your doorstep, it's natural to
smile and be thankful. He enjoys being the bearer of good things. But no
one misunderstands what is what, or feels bad for the joy caused or
relayed. When the moment is passed, he returns to bring more flowers to
someone else. He knows that the people he visits are made happy by who
sent the flowers, and not because of him. His joy lies in serving as a
means of connection; yours in what is received. And God's love is the
source of that gift.

When people praise us, we've delivered something to them that has
sweetened their lives. This sweetness draws from a Source, and we act as
the channel connecting those two for a moment. The more one serves this
connection, the greater the praise and happiness of the ones served.
There is nothing bad in this. It only goes wrong when the lamp believes
that its light is unique to itself.

* Self-honesty
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: self-honesty

I like connecting the ideas of humility and self-honesty. Consider a
mirror: Whatever it shows does not come from the mirror itself. Someone
beautiful might appear in it, or someone not; but there is never a
reason to be prideful or abashed.

If the soul is a perfect mirror -- perhaps clouded by imperfections for
a time -- humility is being faithful to the process of revelation,
rather than tying our heart to what is revealed.
