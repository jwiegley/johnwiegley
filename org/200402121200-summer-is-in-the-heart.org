#+title: Summer is in the heart

#+BEGIN_VERSE
lazily drifting on the breeze
scents of summer, jasmine and orange
the sun tinging all with gold
beneath skies of spotted blue
the music of leaves, of crickets
of midnight frogs in the trees
soft grass between my toes
the cool touch of the lake
and ringing tones of laughter...

whatever season it may be
summer is in the heart.
