    Have you ever known a smile to catch fire?
    to smolder in the kindling of a man's heart
    to provoke daring tongues of flame
    and by puffs of darkling smoke
    betray the heat that gathers
    of a moment's quiet admiration?

    I should call your mouth an oyster
    for all the pearls it reveals;
    and your beaming face: some far-off star,
    that sailors, in their wandering night
    might set sail for
    and guide their journey home.

    And your smile is so much like the dawn
    that on the horizon of your lovely face
    summons all the bright glories of day.
