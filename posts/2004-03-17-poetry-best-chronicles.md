    Poetry best chronicles the devastation of the heart.

    Whether lost love,
    or mystical transcendence,
    or abasing fear.

    Whatever eradicates the man, and leaves the lover only:
    alone, wondering, debating the validity of his feelings against
      a universe of other concerns.

    Only when we truly feel the triviality of our experience,
    does it somehow become genuine.
