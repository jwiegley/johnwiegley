We dwell in Reality, but do we see it? A great part of what we perceive seems
to be our own self reflected back at us: feeling real enough to drive our
emotions, desires, and fears.

It’s like being in an empty room with white walls. We face one of those walls,
except in addition to perceiving what’s in front of us, we project onto it as
well: a constant movie of whatever occupies our mind and hearts. We find this
movie so engaging that the wall fully disappears and we take the movie to be
identical with reality.
