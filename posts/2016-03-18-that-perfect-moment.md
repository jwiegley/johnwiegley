title: That perfect moment
tags: poetry

    I was not made to be perfect.
    I was made flawed, for that moment
    when I discover perfection despite myself --
    because I willed it with a earnest heart.

    The beauty of the rose emerges from soil,
    and the finest spring day, after winter's toil;
    A reed is cracked, that the pen's ink may flow,
    as a lover's mind is broken, for the heart to know.
