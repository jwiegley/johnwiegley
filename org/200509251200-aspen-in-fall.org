Yesterday I drove up to Aspen, Colorado on what might have been one of
the prettiest days of the year. The weather was cool but warm, the trees
were changing color in indescribable patterns of brilliant gold and
yellow and red... I was able to capture just
[[file:gallery/Colorado/Aspen/index.html][a few pictures]], although it
does nothing to equal the beauty of the trip itself. One a day like that
one, I realized that when men grow tired of the world, it's the world of
men they've had too much of. Beauty like this seemed like God's face,
cloaked in the form of leaves and branches. It was among the most
beautiful drives I've ever taken.
