#+title: Poem to the Sea

#+BEGIN_VERSE
I watch you, my friend,
your vast belly
undulating in rhythms
to some mystic dance;
your gentle suspirations
and balming murmurs
that leave the heart entranced;
your cold and watery hues:
now green in the shallows
now black in the depths --
where uncounted fathoms
halt the light's advance:
I call you the sea --
but every moment you change.
You defy my conceptions.
You swallow whole
my ships of fancy --
as you wash away the words
I write upon your sands.
