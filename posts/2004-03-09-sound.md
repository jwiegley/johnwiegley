    The blue thumbprints of an artist's proof,
    labelled on white spheres of alabaster
    deep set into a skull of ash
    baked in a stone oven.

    Befriend the troubled -- his last ray of hope
    as a blooded sun casts shadows
    on the pitiless hearts of those
    who would call him nothing.

    Terrified, lonely, consorting with demons
    that abide ever between heart and mind,
    all waiting to lead unwary souls to
    the yawning gates of perdition.
