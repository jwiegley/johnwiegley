title: Absorption in the Deity

I do not know if the concept of "annihilation" (or, nothingness) expressed
in the Writings is related to the "absorption" mentioned in that
definition. But in respect to the ideas of "union", "God", and the
Manifestation of God, there are a few analogies that help me to frame these
elements into a single picture.

First, when I look up at the sun in the sky, I say that I am seeing the
sun, and everyone would agree that it is the sun I'm looking at. However, I
can only ever commune with the rays of the sun. Direct association with the
sun itself is impossible, owing both to distance, and the fragile nature of
my being compared to the perfect immensity and grandeur of its sphere. And
while for the rays there is almost no identity between their being and that
of the sun -- only an intimate association -- for myself there is no
distinction. I have never known the sun, but I can know its rays.

When I read about union with the Deity, I read it as a union with His Rays,
much in the sense that a plant unites with the rays to produce its life and
energy. Even though there is no identification of the plant with the rays,
or any dissolution of the rays into the plant's being, there is an effect
of the ray's qualities upon the plant, which later appear as growth and
beauty.

Another expression of this idea is found in an art gallery. Though a
painting may be wonderfully constructed, in a dark room its being is equal
to no being. However, if it enter the presence of a full, white light, it
can come alive with vibrant colors and shapes. These colors and shapes are
an association of the painting with the light, but the light does not
become infused into the painting. The painting "unites" with the light by
its being shone upon, and thus manifests its latent qualities according to
its potential, but at the same time the light is wholly sanctified from the
baser material of the painting.

As for what we must do, a second analogy is that of a television
set. Although a TV is at all times literally bathed in signals coming from
the broadcasting station, it must attune itself to receive and display
those signals clearly. I see this as similar to the Law of God, which a
soul must align itself with. After this, the most important qualities for
the TV are: receptivity, purity of being (so its screen is clear), and
constancy. If these are present, God's qualities may become manifest, to
some degree, in that earthly agency.

Now when a person watches a well-functioning TV set, they may at first
admire the TV itself, but quickly they become lost in the show. In fact,
the best TV is one that fades into non-being while playing a programme,
such that the viewers feel they are fully immersed. This implies that not
only is obedience to the Law mandatory for the mystic's attunement, but
also self-effacement so that these divine qualities may be faithfully
reflected.

In sum, I see the mystic like a mirror. He cleanses himself as much as
possible, every day; he aligns himself with the Sun -- or really, Its Rays;
and he strives for purity such that one looking upon him would not be able
to discover any individual being apart from the light he reflects. This is
union, although not a physical or existential union; it is a sameness of
manifest being, at the same time as a complete separation of inherent
being. This same experience happens with real mirrors, which may be so
completely clear, that one must touch the glass to convince themselves it
is there at all. At first, one may think the mirror and its image are in
fact one (unity), but in truth there may be an immeasurable distance
between them, such as with the Sun.
