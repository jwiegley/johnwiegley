#+BEGIN_VERSE
To see the summer sun
riding on chariots of cloud
needs only eyes.

But feeling the weeping of winter rains
is more than bodies of flesh can do.

When do water drops become tears,
or the sun's rays, a kiss of warmth?
When is the cold Earth like a gift,
bringing forth wonder and beauty and hope?

What eyes have I? that see in the world of atoms
an image to set my soul on fire...

For somehow:
  vibration yields sound,
  energy, color,
  warmth, love,
  space, freedom,
  and on a cold and starry night,
  the whispers of the soul's vehement longing...

When did it happen?
that a man of such ordinary thoughts
found himself everywhere surrounded by Beauty.
