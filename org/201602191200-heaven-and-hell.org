#+title: Heaven and hell

#+BEGIN_VERSE
In Heaven
thirst is prized:
it reveals the flavor of water;
drinking is prized:
it unites one with the Source;
and the Ocean is life
the Object of all desire.

But in Hell
thirst is torment:
it reveals what is lacking;
drinking is despised:
it cannot satisfy;
and the Ocean is death
to the burning flame of desire.
