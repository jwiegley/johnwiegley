    Poetry, music, or art
    is something we use to equate
    ourselves with a greater beauty outside.

    In the falling leaves of autumn,
    or the raindrops that lie with sadness on the ground,

    We behold something in nature --
    isolated for a single moment by our attention --
    that draws out from our hearts
    an impulse toward something greater.
