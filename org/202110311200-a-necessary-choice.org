title: A necessary choice
tags: journal

Imagine, using the warden example, that we were given a choice of
grilled cheese, chicken, or fish for dinner. Now, say God knows in
advance that we're always going to choose the grilled cheese. So the
question is, why doesn't He just offer us only grilled cheese? What's
the difference?

Perhaps part of the purpose of this life is not just our choices, but
for /us/ to realize that we knowingly chose the grilled cheese over the
chicken and the fish. If the grilled cheese were our only choice, there
would be neither blame nor praise in us having chosen it. But if we know
there are other choices available, and yet we choose that one --- even
if someone who knows us best knows beforehand what we will choose ---
still /we/ do not know what we will choose, and /just the knowledge of
the other options tells us something about our choice/.

Right, this existence is meant to shine a lot on our souls /for us/. I
think the external understanding of judgment, as if this is some big
contest to win God's affection, has it inside-out. This is about the
birth of awareness, not winning some cosmic game.
