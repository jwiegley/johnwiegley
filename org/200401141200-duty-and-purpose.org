title: Duty and purpose
tags: journal

From early this morning, a simpler thought on duty and love that seems
to demonstrate their interrelated importance: Duty is like purpose, and
love like meaning. Purpose alone is a fine book that says little;
meaning alone is a beautiful thought never written.

I don't know if there is really a "true" way to look at the world. But
there are ways to imagine things that produce different feelings in our
hearts, and from those, different actions. What leads to the best
outcome for each individual: is that all we can know of the best way to
see?
