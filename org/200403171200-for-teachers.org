title: For teachers

"In a drop thou beholdest the secrets of the sea" | so with all the
perfections potential in thee. | | As a teacher draws forth from the
days of youth | our thoughts and ideas on the subject of truth, | | the
mind develops, and the hearts unfold -- | bearing diamonds and rubies,
emeralds and gold -- | | from that inner land, hidden in the eyes of a
babe, | every great man and woman is made.
